In light of the recent U.S. presidential election race between candidates Donald Trump and Hillary Clinton, there have been large amounts of interest in the controversy involving Hillary's use of personal email accounts on non-government servers during her previous career as Secretary of State. 
After a number of Freedom of Information lawsuits were filed against the Department of State, the Department of State released on August 31, 2015 nearly 7,000 pages of Clinton's heavily redacted communications in PDF form.

Subsequent to this release, the data science competition website Kaggle released a sanitized version of the extracted content of the emails for public use and analysis. 
Our group was interested in analyzing and exploring this data given its connection to current events at the time.
