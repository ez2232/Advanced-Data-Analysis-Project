Our main objective with this project was to reduce the immense dimensionality and volume of the data so that the resulting output could be more easily digested by a data analyst or other interested party. 
We wanted to find patterns in the data that might be of interest, such as communities of receiving or sending parties that shared certain commonalities. 

However, rather than simply report on the results of such analysis, we believed that a more effective way to communicate results and allow for the generation of new insights would be to create an interactive visualization that would empower the user to both view our findings and explore the simplified data at will.
