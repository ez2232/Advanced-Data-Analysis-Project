The social network and summarized text data is combined into a visualization that can be displayed in RShiny. The RShiny dashboard uses the packages visNetwork and igraph. visNetwork is an R package for visualizing networks that allows users to create dynamic and interactive visualizations. Users can physically manipulate edges and nodes in a network graph, select and view nodes by group, and customize the appearance of the network with colors and images. igraph is a set of fast and easy to use network analysis tools in R that allows the user to quickly set up and define network graph relationships that can then be ported over to visNetwork for visualization.
