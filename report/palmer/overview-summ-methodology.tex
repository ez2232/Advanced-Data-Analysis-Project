Because one of our main goals is to create a visual dashboard for our users, we have to be careful about our bookkeeping while we slice and dice our text data. 
A brief overview of our procedure from end-to-end for one e-mail is as follows:
\begin{enumerate}
\item Split the e-mail into sentences.
\item Clean each sentence.
\item Represent each sentence as a bag-of-words.
\item Run TextRank to get a ranking of the bags-of-words.
\item Return the top $k$ sentences from the original e-mail associated with the top $k$ ranking bags-of-words.
\end{enumerate}

Of particular importance to our implementation is keeping track of how the bags-of-words are associated with the original sentences from the e-mail, as the bags-of-words are not nearly as informative to the user.
