The social network analysis in the previous section has discovered close relationship between Clinton and a group of her email receivers. The cluster analysis in this section focuses on classifying the receivers' emails in a meaningful way. It is useful to inspect the trends of the language Clinton has used when speaking with different people/groups of people. The clustering analysis is normally useful to categorize large sum of text into groups based on similarities. For exploratory purpose while analysing Clinton's emails, we would like to see if we can categorize based on the language used emails from different circles of people. Due to time limit, we only focuses on the top 10 accounts who have received most emails from Clinton.
