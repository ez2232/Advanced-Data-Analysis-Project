The social network analysis in the previous section has discovered close relationships between Clinton various groups of her email receivers. The cluster analysis in this section focuses on classifying the receivers' emails in a meaningful way. It is useful to inspect the language Clinton used when speaking with different people/groups of people. Clustering analysis is normally useful to categorize large quantities of text into groups based on similarities. For exploratory purposes, we would like to see if we can categorize emails based on the language used by different circles of people. Due to the time limit, we only focused on the top 10 accounts that received the most emails from Clinton.
