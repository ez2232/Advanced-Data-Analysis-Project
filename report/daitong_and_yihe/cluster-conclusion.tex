The style of language in Hillary's emails to her closely connected lawyers and journalist is much lengthier and more focused on discussing certain `agreement' terms. In fact, 50\% of all the texts in Hillary's sent emails are addressed to Sidney Blumenthal and Cheryl Mills (they place among the top 10 receivers). Hillary also writes lengthy emails to her aide Monica Hanley. These three receivers are clustered into one group by analyzing the text similarities. 

This grouping, however, might also be caused by the availability of data. If we had more emails for the other receivers, the clustering results might be different. Another limitation is the number of receivers concerned. Due to the project time limit, only 10 receivers were considered, which might have limited the analysis to certain language styles for the top receivers. Moreover, most of the emails in this dataset are only partially available. Having the full text of each might reveal new characteristics of the language style and thus leads to different clustering results.

Therefore, potential future work could involve using a better dataset, analyzing more receivers, applying the methods to a non-redacted set of emails, and trying out different clustering methods.
