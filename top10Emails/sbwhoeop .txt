Jake -- I was so moved by Hillary's powerful presence today on the screen as I watched along with millions in America
and around the world. She was emphathetic and unflinching and inspiring; she was wise and steady and strong. My 80
year old mother called from LA to say "She was like our rock of Gibraltar". What greater compliment for the Secretary of
State on such an awful day? I salute her as well as you and your colleagues who crafted her remarks under tremendous
time and factual constraints. It really showed everyone the stuff of which she's made. With admiration and affection --
Liz

Re: Magariaf and the attack on US in Libya
SOURCE: Sources with direct access to the Libyan National Transitional Council, as
well as the highest levels of European Governments, and Western Intelligence and
security services.
1. During the afternoon of September 11, 2012 new interim President of Libya
Mohammed Yussef el Magariaf spoke in private with senior advisors, including the
members of the Libyan Muslim Brotherhood, to discuss the attacks by demonstrators
on U.S. missions in Tripoli and Benghazi. According to a sensitive source, el Magariaf
was shaken by the attacks, and gave permission to commanders on the ground for
security forces to open fire over the heads of the crowds in an effort to break up mobs

attacking the missions. During this session, a senior security officer told el Magariaf
that the attacks on that day were inspired by what many devout Libyan viewed as a
sacrilegious internet video on the prophet Mohammed originating in America. The
Libyan attacks were also inspired by and linked to an attack on the U.S. mission in
Egypt on the same day. At the same time, el Magariaf noted in strong terms that the
atmosphere that made fostered these incidents in Libya is the product of widespread
publicity regarding the security situation in the country between 2004 and 2010 and
the cooperation that developed between a number of Western Intelligence services and
the regime of former dictator Muammar al Qaddafi.
2. This source added that el Magariafs advisors believe that this situation adds
to the President's growing concern over the unpredictable effects that will follow
current covert efforts by his political opponents to link him directly to foreign
intelligence services. According to a separate sensitive source, el Magariaf noted that
his opponents had often tried to connect him to the U.S. Central Intelligence Agency
(CIA) through the National Front for the Salvation of Libya (NFSL), a group
established in opposition to former dictator Muammar al Qaddafi, which el Magariaf
led in the 198 OS. In the opinion of this individual el Magariaf believes that he can
survive potential negative publicity in this regard, but if this situation continues to
develop in this manner it will complicate his efforts to establish an orderly
administration in the country. Again, he stated that the attacks on the U.S. missions
were as much a result of the atmosphere created by this campaign, as the controversial
internet video.
3. At the same time, this individual noted that several of el Magariafs advisors
share his concerns in this matter, pointing out that the return of Qaddafi's intelligence
chief Abdullah al-Senoussi for trial in Libya has heightened public interest in the
liaison relationships conducted by the CIA and British Secret Intelligence Service (SIS)
with Qaddfi's intelligence and security services. These same individuals note that they
believe Islamist militia forces under the command of General Abdelhakim Belhaj
captured files and documents describing this relationship from Qaddafi's offices in
Tripoli. This fascination with Western intelligence operations in Qaddafi's Libya is also
driven by Human Rights Watch (HRW) and its efforts to tie Western governments to
human rights violations committed under Qaddafi. In this regard HRIAr has
interviewed at least fourteen (14) individuals claiming that they were turned over to
Qaddafi's forces by the Western powers. Belhaj is included in this group.
4. (Source Comment: In the opinion of a very sensitive source, el Magariafs
enemies are working to take advantage of his suspected links to the CIA at a time when
Western intelligence services are under scrutiny in Libya. They also fear that this
situation will only grow more complex as Qaddafi's son Saif al Islam Qaddafi and al
Senousi are brought before Libyan courts to answer for their crimes under the old
regime, particularly during the 2011 revolution. These individuals believe both men
will be linked to Western Intelligence during their trials..)

5. According to this individual, el Magariaf is working with the Muslim
Brotherhood and other Islamist groups to defuse this situation. He is particularly
concerned by the level of violence between Sufi Muslims and Salafists, and believes he
must maintain his reputation for impartiality if he is to defuse this growing problem.
As he works to organize the government, and disarm the militias, he cannot afford to
lose the respect and trust of the Libyan people, especially at a time when cultural
clashes between followers of the mystical Sufi tradition and ultra-conservative Salafis
have taken central stage in the new Libya. This source adds that these religious
conflicts were largely unknown during Qaddafi's rule.
6. (Source Comment: This source added that the individuals interviewed for the
HRW report were former members of the Libyan Islamist Fighting Group (LIFG), an
Islamist group formed in opposition to Gaddafi's controversial interpretations of Islam.
These LIFG fighters fled the country in the late 198os and went to Afghanistan to join
the fight against the Soviet Union while also gaining training and experience for their
own struggle. A separate source adds that messages to Libya from the CIA and SIS
were found among the Tripoli Documents published by HRW, indicating that the
United States and Britain were eager to help Libya capture several senior LIFG figures,
including its co-founders, Belhaj and Sarni al-Saadi.)
7. As Libyan authorities struggle to control the armed rings that refuse to
surrender weapons following last year's civil war, Salafis, who say Islam should return
to the simple ways followed by Mohammed, have established their own armed gangs in
post-Gaddafi Libya. They view Sufi practices as idolatrous. Since the start of the Arab
Spring uprising across the region, a number of Sufi sites have been attacked in Egypt,
Mali and Libya. Magariaf is determined to establish a democratic state based on
Islamic principles. This individual adds that Magariaf remains dedicated to the idea of
building a tolerant Islamic state in Libya. El Magariafs opinions continue to be shaped
by his experience with Qaddafi, whom he felt built a cult of personality in violation of
all of the basic ideas of Islam.

Subject: FVV: Benghazi update (1200 local)
Update from Rep. Stevens in Benghazi, based on largely on info from acting PM Ali Tarhouni and acting FM
Salah Bishari:
• TNC caretaker cabinet/members were up until 4am following events in Tripoli and discussing plans for
the coming days. Tarhouni said the TNC has been in constant communication with its people in Tripoli,
including both fighters and those entrusted with implementing the stabilization plans. Rebels in Tripoli,
in coordination with the TNC, have begun to set up checkpoints inside the city and guard public
buildings.
• TNC chairman Abd al Jalil and PM Jibril made statements to the media last night, urging people to
refrain from revenge attacks and destruction of public buildings.
• There has so far been "no bloodbath" or serious looting.
• The capture of Sail al-Islam al-Qadhafi and Mohamed al-Qadhafi is significant The TNC, including
Abd al-Jalil himself, intervened with rebels surrounding Mohamed's house to ensure that they did not
harm him. They understood that it would be harmful to the revolution and the TNC if he were
killed. These events were captured live by Al Jazeera in interviews with Mohamed. Both brothers are
in rebel custody (at this time, it is unclear to us exactly who is holding them, however).
• Per Tarhouni, the next steps are: 1) find Muammar Qadhafi; 2) issue a statement announcing the end of
the Qadhafi regime and the start of the interim period under the INC (TNC staff have begun drafting
this statement already); 3) insure the delivery of essential services and commodities (esp addressing the
acute shortages of fuel, children's milk, and medication for blood pressure and diabetes); and 4) move
the TNC to Tripoli.
• Regarding the move to Tripoli, Tarhouni said security arrangements would need to be made before they
could send the TNC.' leadership to the capital. We have heard from another contact that some TNC
members are already making plans to fly to Misurata and the Western Mountains, possibly as early as
today, and from there drive to Tripoli.
• Request for assistance: Tarhouni, who also holds US citizenship, said the items listed above (gas, diesel,
baby milk, and medicine) are urgently needed in Tripoli and recommended that the USG ship those
items directly to Zawiya's Port and publicize such assistance as soon as feasible (in coordination with
the INC). He said this would bring tlie US even more goodwill than it has already earned bore

Re: Plans of new Libyan PM
SOURCE: Sources with direct access to the Libyan National Transitional Council, as well as the
highest levels of European Governments, and Western Intelligence and security services.
1.On October 15, 2012, new Libya Prime Minister All Zidan discussed the future structure of
his cabinet and administration with senior advisors to interim President Yussef el Magariaf.
According to a sensitive source, Zidan stated that he intends to draw on all sectors of the Libyan
political world to form his cabinet. He also advised that while be must proceed with caution he will
have at least one and possibly as many as three members of the Muslim Brotherhood (MB) and its
Justice and Construction Party (JCP) included M the cabinet. Zidari believes that he can find
members of the JCP and other Islamist groups who support his plan for establishing a moderate
Islamic state, while maintaining good working relations with the United States and Western Europe.
Zidan also plans to reach out to the supporters of Islamist General Abdel Hakim Alamin Belhaj, who
he believes can be used as a balance against al Qafda in the Islamic Maghreb (AQIM) and Ansar al

Brotherhood Government of Egypt to use Egyptian oil service firms to replace Western firms in
supporting the Libyan oil industry. Zidan is skeptical about this idea, fearing that Libya could become
too dependent on Egypt for technical expertise. He believes that Western firms provide the
opportunity to maintain independence and balance in the oil sector.
3.(Source Comment: In the opinion of this source, Zidan, who served at the Libyan Mission to
India for two years before defecting to the West in 1980, joining Magariaf and his anti- Qadd.afi
National Front for the Salvation of Libya (NFSL), plans to work with all of the parties and groups in
the GNC. At the same time his history gives the Prime Minister a relationship with the President and
a degree of credibility that will be helpful as he forms his cabinet. According to this source, Zidan
wants to move quickly to name a cabinet. His position is also strengthened by the fact that he worked
on behalf of the National Transitional Council (NTC) during the 2011Civil War, organizing
international support for the rebels. According to this sensitive source, Ziclan's immediate concerns
include organizing the investigation of the September ii attack on the U.S. Consulate in Benghazi,
and the resulting assassination of Ambassador Christopher Stevens and three other Americans. Zidan
is already under pressure from the U.S. Government to move the investigation along as quickly as
possible.)
4. In the opinion of this individual Zidan realizes that the attack on the U.S. consulate is now
an international symbol of the security issues at play in Libya, and that the use of pro-government
militias to provide security is not a long term solution to the problem. Zidan believes that the idea
that the government must ask for support from the powerful militias from Misrata and Zintan
undermines his efforts to bring order and centralized authority to the country. Zidan believes that he
can address this problem in part by developing a working majority in the GNC drawing on moderates
and independents, who will support his efforts to establish a modern Islamic regime that can work
with the West, particularly International Oil Companies. That said, he cautions his advisors that he
does not anticipate real success in this regard until the latter part of 2013.

Re: Plans of new Libyan PM
SOURCE: Sources with direct access to the Libyan National Transitional Council, as well as
the highest levels of European Governments, and Western Intelligence and security services.
On October 15, 2012, new Libya Prime Minister Ali Zidan discussed the future
structure of his cabinet and administration with senior advisors to interim President Yussef el
Ma,gariaf According to a sensitive source, Zidan stated that he intends to draw on all sectors of
the Libyan political world to form his cabinet. He also advised that while he must proceed with
caution he will have at least one and possibly as many as three members of the Muslim
Brotherhood (MB) and its Justice and Construction Party (JCP) included in the cabinet. Zidan
believes that he can find members of the JCP and other Islamist groups who support his plan for
establishing a moderate Islamic state, while maintaining good working relations with the United
States and Western Europe. Zidan also plans to reach out to the supporters of Islamist General
Abdel Hakim Alainin Belhaj, who he believes can be used as a balance against al Oarda in the
Islamic Maghreb (AQIM) and Ansar al Sharia as they attempt to undermine the new
administration.

At Andrews Air Force Base on Friday, a military band played "Nearer, My God, to Thee." Marines in dress uniforms
carried to four black hearses the flag-draped caskets of the Americans, including Winchester native Glen Doherty, killed
at our consulate in Libya. President Obama and Secretary of State Hillary Clinton led the solemn ceremony, Clinton
speaking before him.
"If the last few days teach us anything, let it be this: that this work and the men and women who risk their lives to do it
are at the heart of what makes America great and good," said Clinton, her voice at times uneven with emotion for the
dead men she had employed.
Then she said: "So we will wipe away our tears, stiffen our spines, and face the future undaunted."
It was a perfect line for America and for Americans who try to keep peace in a smoldering Middle East. It was a line, too,
that captured — unwittingly or not — how Clinton has lived her life. How many times since this woman took center
stage in this country nearly 20 years ago has she, privately and publicly, wiped away her tears, stiffened her spine, and
faced the future undaunted.
Clinton appeared to be crying again as she listened to Obama, seeming stricken himself. And when Obama finished and
walked back behind the podium, Clinton reached for his hand like an older sister or even a mother, and held it for a
second or two. It was a moment the history books will remember.
There was the first black president on the verge of re-election, or not. There was the woman expected to be the first
female president, until he showed up out of nowhere. There was the rivalry and tortured history, Bill Clinton ever the
third actor in the shadows. But all of it was put aside for something bigger than politics or egos: their country. We don't
see enough of that anymore.
When her husband was president, I made a career out of trashing Hillary Clinton's hairdos, pantsuits, her attempted
health care coup, her right-wing conspiracy theories, her staying with that slippery serial philanderer. Four years ago in
the presidential primary I rooted for Obama over her.
Yet when she finally conceded a totally unexpected defeat, a different Hillary Clinton began to emerge. She surprised us
by accepting a consolation prize, secretary of state. She then went on to perform it so ably that nearly two-thirds of
Americans, an almost unprecedented percentage, approve of her and her rehabilitated — or so we hope — spouse.
More than once since 2008 I've wondered: Would she have done a better job than Obama? I don't know. But I do know I
sold this woman short.
In awful moments in history, some leaders rise to the occasion, and some don't. Think Ronald Reagan's reassurance
after the Challenger disaster. Or George Bush on the rubble of Ground Zero after 9/11, telling the world we'd never
forget. Friday, by comparison, was a tiny moment. Still, Hillary Clinton rose to meet it.

Subject: FW: Benghazi update (1200 local)
Update from Rep. Stevens in Benghazi, based on largely on info from acting PM Ali Tarhouni and acting FM
Salah Bishari:
• TNC caretaker cabinet/members were up until 4am following events in Tripoli and discussing plans for
the coming days. Tarhouni said the TNC has been in constant communication with its people in Tripoli,
including both fighters and those entrusted with implementing the stabilization plans. Rebels in Tripoli,
in coordination with the TNC, have begun to set up checkpoints inside the city and guard public
buildings.
• INC chairman Abd al Jalil and PM Jibril made statements to the media last night, urging people to
refrain from revenge attacks and destruction of public buildings.
• There has so far been "no bloodbath" or serious looting.
• The capture of Saif al-Islam al-Qadhafi and Mohamed al-Qadhafi is significant. The TNC, including
Abd al-Jalil himself, intervened with rebels surrounding Mohamed's house to ensure that they did not
harm him. They understood that it would be harmful to the revolution and the TNC if he were
killed. These events were captured live by Al Jazeera in interviews with Mohamed. Both brothers are
in rebel custody (at this time, it is unclear to us exactly who is holding Clem, however).
• Per Tarhouni, the next steps are: 1) find Muammar Qadhafi; 2) issue a statement announcing the end of
the Qadhafi regime and the start of the interim period under the TNC (TNC staff have begun drafting

this statement already); 3) insure the delivery of essential services and commodities (esp. addressing the
acute shortages of fuel, children's milk, and medication for blood pressure and diabetes); and 4) move
the INC to Tripoli.
• Regarding the move to Tripoli, Tarhouni said security arrangements would need to be made before they
could send the INC leadership to the capital. We have heard from another contact that some TNC
members are already making plans to fly to Misurata and the Western Mountains, possibly as early as
today, and from there drive to Tripoli.
• Request for assistance: Tarhouni, who also holds US citizenship, said the items listed above (gas, diesel,
baby milk, and medicine) are urgently needed in Tripoli and recommended that the IJSG ship those
items directly to Zawiya's Port and publicize such assistance as soon as feasible (in coordination with
the TNC). He said this would bring the US even more goodwill than it has already earned here.

Secretary Clinton's leadership on Libya
HRC has been a critical voice on Libya in administration deliberations, at NATO, and in contact group
meetings — as well as the public face of the U.S. effort in Libya. She was instrumental in securing the
authorization, building the coalition, and tightening the noose around Qadhafi and his regime.
February 25 — HRC announces the suspension of operations of the Libyan embassy in Washington.
February 26 — HRC directs efforts to evacuate all U.S. embassy personnel from Tripoli and orders the closing of
the embassy.
February 26 HRC made a series of calls to her counterparts to help secure passage of UNSC 1970, which
imposes sanctions on Gaddafi and his family and refers Qadhafi and his cronies to the ICC
February 28 — HRC travels to Geneva, Switzerland for consultations with European partners on Libya. She
gives a major address in which she says: "Colonel Qadhafi and those around him must be held accountable for
these acts, which violate international legal obligations and common decency. Through their actions, they have
lost the legitimacy to govern. And the people of Libya have made themselves clear: It is time for Qadhafi to go
— now, without further violence or delay." She also works to secure the suspension of Libya from membership
in the Human Rights Council.
Early March — HRC appoints Special Envoy Chris Stevens to be the U.S. representative to Benghazi
March 14 — HRC travels to Paris for the G8 foreign minister's meeting. She meets with TNC representative
Jibril and consults with her colleagues on further UN Security Council action. She notes that a no-fly zone will
not be adequate.
March 14-16 — HRC participates in a series of high-level video- and teleconferences
She is a leading voice for strong UNSC action and a NA TO civilian
protection mission.

March 17— HRC secures Russian abstention and Portuguese and African support for UNSC 1973, ensuring that
it passes. 1973 authorizes a no-fly zone over Libya and "all necessary measures" - code for military action - to
protect civilians against Gaddafts army.
March 24 — HRC engages with allies and secures the transition of command and control of the civilian
protection mission to NATO. She announces the transition in a statement.
March 18-30— HRC engages with UAE, Qatar, and Jordan to seek their participation in coalition
operations. Over the course of several days, all three devote aircraft to the mission.
March 19 — HRC travels to Paris to meet with European and Arab leaders to prepare for military action to
protect civilians. That night, the first U.S. air strikes halt the advance of Gaddafi's forces on Benghazi and
target Libya's air defenses.
March 29 — HRC travels to London for a conference on Libya, where she is a driving force behind the creation
of a Contact Group comprising 20-plus countries to coordinate efforts to protect civilians and plan for a post-
Qadhafi Libya. She is instrumental in setting up a rotating chair system to ensure regional buy-in.
April 14— HRC travels to Berlin for NATO meetings. She is the driving force behind NATO adopting a
communique that calls for Qadhafi's departure as a political objective, and lays out three clear military
objectives: end of attacks and threat of attacks on civilians; the removal of Qadhafi forces from cities they
forcibly entered; and the unfettered provision of humanitarian access.
May 5 — HRC travels to Rome for a Contact Group meeting. The Contact Group establishes a coordination
system and a temporary financial mechanism to funnel money to the TNC.
June 8 — HRC travels to Abu Dhabi for another Contact Group meeting and holds a series of intense discussions
with rebel leaders.
June 12 — HRC travels to Addis for consultations and a speech before the African Union, pressing the case for a
democratic transition in Libya.
July 15 — HRC travels to Istanbul and announces that the U.S. recognizes the TNC as the legitimate government
of Libya. She also secures recognition from the other members of the Contact Group.
Late June — HRC meets with House Democrats and Senate Republicans to persuade them not to de-fund the
Libya operation.
July 16 — HRC sends Feltman, Cretz, and Chollet to Tunis to meet with Qadhafi envoys "to deliver a clear and
firm message that the only way to move forward, is for Qadhafi to step down".
Early August — HRC works to construct a $1.5 billion assets package to be approved by the Security Council
and sent to the TNC. That package is working through its last hurdles.
Early August -- After military chief Abdel Fattah Younes is killed, S sends a personal message to TNC head
Jalil to press for a responsible investigation and a careful and inclusive approach to creating a new executive
council
Early August -- HRC secures written pledges from the TNC to an inclusive, pluralistic democratic
transition. She continues to consult with European and Arab colleagues on the evolving situation.

By MARGARET COKER in Benghazi, Libya and ADAM ENTOUS, JAY SOLOMON and SIOBHAN GORMAN in Washington
Limited Security in Benghazi, Secrecy Over Safe House, Contributed to Tragedy
The U.S. Consulate in Benghazi under attack on Sept. 11. The deadly assault raised questions about security lapses and
misjudgments by U.S. officials.
The deadly assault on a U.S. diplomatic mission in Libya on Sept. 11 was preceded by a succession of security lapses and
misjudgments, compounded by fog-of-battle decisions, that raise questions about whether the scope of the tragedy
could have been contained.
U.S, officials issued alerts and ordered security precautions in neighboring Egypt ahead of protests and violence on Sept.
11, but largely overlooked the possibility of trouble at other diplomatic postings in the region.
The State Department chose to maintain only limited security in Benghazi, Libya, despite months of sporadic attacks
there on U.S. and other Western missions. And while the U.S. said it would ask Libya to boost security there, it did so just
once, for a one week period in June, according to Libyan officials.
The U.S. didn't seriously consider sending in the military during the attack. It summoned rapid-response teams of
Marines only after the U.S. ambassador was dead. State Department officials said they doubted the Pentagon could
have mobilized a rescue force quickly enough to make a difference during the fighting. The Pentagon waited for
guidance from State, which is responsible for diplomatic security, a senior military official said,

Adding a new dimension to the chain of events, the siege also engulfed what officials now describe as a secret safe
house used by American officials and security personnel involved in sensitive government programs after last year's
Libyan revolution.
Even when that building, also known as the "annex," came under attack, U.S. officials were reluctant to divulge its
existence, and the secrecy complicated the Libyan response and the eventual American evacuation, according to Libyan
security officials.
The Obama administration has defended levels of security in place. Though intelligence officials are investigating
indications al Qaeda's North African affiliate had connections with militants who mounted the attack, U.S. officials say
the evidence still indicates it was a spontaneous response to protests in Cairo against an anti-Islamic video. But a
detailed review based on interviews with more than a dozen U.S. and Libyan officials shows months of ominous signals
suggesting the need for better security, along with missed chances for delivering it.
President Barack Obama, in his re-election campaign, gets high marks from voters on national security, but has drawn
Republican criticism over his handling of the anti-American protests.
After a classified briefing to lawmakers by Secretary of State Hillary Clinton Thursday, Sen. Susan Collins (R., Maine)
called the security "woefully inadequate, given the security-threat environment." The State Department has convened
an Accountability Review Board to investigate the attack, something it is required to do after such an incident.
U.S. officials still are struggling to piece together details of the attack. For more than a week after U.S. Ambassador
Christopher Stevens was killed, the State Department couldn't say why he was in Benghazi. On Thursday, officials said
they believed he was there to attend the launch of a joint U.S.-Libyan cultural and educational program.
Mr. Stevens and Sean Smith, an information officer, were killed at the consulate, in the first wave of the attack. Former
Navy SEALs Glen Doherty and Tyrone Woods died later, at the sensitive safe house or annex a kilometer away. It remains
unclear to U.S. and Libyan officials whether the militants knew of that facility or just followed a U.S. convoy to it after
the consulate attack.
The apparent lapses extended to firefighting equipment. Rescue attempts at the main building were thwarted in part by
the absence of smoke-protection masks and fire extinguishers, said Libyan guards. Senior State Department officials said
these wouldn't have provided sufficient protection against the diesel-fueled inferno.
State Department officials said security for the consulate was frequently reviewed and was deemed sufficient to counter
what U.S. officials considered to be the most likely threat at the time: a limited hit-and-run attack with rocket-propelled
grenades or improvised explosive devices, or IEDs.
There was a string of attacks in Benghazi in the months before Sept. 11, including a June 6 IED explosion outside.the
consulate compound. "These types of incidents were the ones that were our principal concerns," a senior State
Department official said. Based on the outcome of the June 6 attack, in which a perimeter wall was damaged but no
Americans hurt, a second State Department official added: "Our security plan worked."
Current and former officials said the security choices in Benghazi reflected efforts by Mr. Stevens to maintain a low-
profile security posture and show faith in Libya's new leaders, despite questions about their ability to rein in heavily
armed bands of militants. Officials say Mr. Stevens personally advised against having Marines posted at the embassy in
Tripoli, apparently to avoid a militarized U.S. presence.
The security plan for the consulate also reflected confidence Mr. Stevens felt in a city where he worked for months with
rebels battling Moammar Gadhafi's rule. State Department officials said he didn't consult with Washington before
traveling to Benghazi, located in an area that has become notorious for its volatile mix of Islamist militancy and heavy
weaponry.

"This is what happens when you're relying on a government that's not in control of the whole country," said Randa
Fahmy Hudome, a former U.S. official. Benghazi "was awash with weapons in the hands of various brigades who were all
in combat with one another. It wasn't a secret."
A State Department official said Washington doesn't control the travels of ambassadors within countries where they are
posted. But some current and former U.S. officials say it was a mistake for the administration to put so much faith in the
Libyans to provide adequate security so soon after the revolution, and questioned why more robust contingency plans
weren't in place.
One senior State Department official described the Benghazi consulate as a "temporary office" that security officers
treated as a "subsidiary" of the embassy in Tripoli, where more strenuous procedures and precautions were in place. "So
Tripoli had the plan and the idea was that these people would just fall back on Tripoli, which they did in this situation, so
it worked," the official said.
Alarm bells about security in Benghazi started sounding this spring.
On April 10, someone threw an explosive device at a convoy carrying United Nations envoy Ian Martin. On May 22, a
rocket-propelled grenade hit offices of the International Committee of the Red Cross.
After the June 6 IED attack on the U.S. consulate, the U.S. asked Libya to step up security around American installations,
said a State Department spokesman. Libyan officials say the request was only for one week. A State Department official
said the temporary security buildup was needed to repair damage to the wall.
The Libyan who received the request said the added security was two extra cars of men plus some heavy machine guns.
After the repairs, Libyan security returned to normal levels: a four-man team of armed guards protecting the perimeter
and four unarmed Libyan guards inside to screen visitors.
Tensions remained high, however. On June 11, a rocket-propelled grenade hit a convoy in Benghazi carrying Britain's
ambassador to Libya, injuring two bodyguards. Britain closed its consulate in Benghazi.
The U.S. deemed the security level sufficient and decided to stay, "given the very important mission that we have in
eastern Libya to support U.S. national security interests," said a senior State Department official. He said "robust"
security improvements had been made to the compound since the Americans moved into it in May 2011, including
cement barriers and barbed wire.
As the attacks mounted in Benghazi, intelligence agencies warned of the growing security risks, but didn't have specific
intelligence about particular threats or planned attacks. On Aug. 27, the State Department issued a travel warning for
Libya, citing a threat of assassinations and car bombings in both Benghazi and Tripoli. The warning said the embassy's
ability to intervene was limited because armed groups behind the attacks were "neither sanctioned nor controlled by
the Libyan government."
In the days before Sept. 11, intelligence agencies issued their annual warning of heightened security risks around the
anniversary of the 2001 attacks. Many counterterrorism officials saw a lessened risk this year than last year, which was
the 10th anniversary and the first one after the killing of Osama bin Laden.
In Libya, embassy personnel conducted a security review right before the anniversary. It determined there was no
reason to think an attack was planned or the consulate in Benghazi was "insufficiently postured," said a senior
administration official.
Across the border in Egypt, red flags appeared on Sept. 8, after a radical Egyptian cleric aired on television portions of an
anti-Islam video believed made in the U.S. Officials at the U.S. embassy in Cairo that night sent the first of several
messages alerting Washington and other embassies in the region to the video and seeking guidance about responding
and the potential for a backlash.

The embassy in Cairo knew the film was beginning to get attention because it was monitoring social media, according to
State Department officials. "That was well ahead of any intelligence that they got from Washington," one official said.
On Monday, Sept. 10, intelligence agencies sent a warning directly to the U.S. embassy in Cairo saying the protests could
turn violent. Diplomatic security officers in Cairo sent most embassy personnel home.
Intelligence analysts at the time had no reason to believe the unrest would spill over to neighboring Libya or beyond,
officials said. State Department officials likewise found no reason to put other embassies in the region on heightened
alert and decided not to call in Marine teams to help in Cairo.
"We have to put this in context: We've had protest after protest in Cairo. We know where the military is. We know
where to find them when we need them," a senior State Department official said.
Ethan Chorin, an American development economist working with U.S. and Libyan officials on a hospital in Benghazi, said
he spoke by phone to Mr. Stevens about an hour before the assault, and the ambassador told him there was "no
indication of trouble" following the protests in Egypt. Mr. Chorin said a subsequent conversation he had with the
ambassador's security officer was cut short by what the officer said was a serious problem. Several minutes later, he
could, hear explosions from his hotel room across town as the assault began.
During a final call by Mr. Chorin to a security officer at the consulate, the attack began, and his call was cut off.
The attack on the consulate compound started shortly after 9:30 p.m. Benghazi time, which was 3:30 p.m. Eastern time,
according to Libyan security guards.
Besides the four armed Libyans outside, five armed State Department diplomatic security officers were at the consulate.
Diplomatic security agent David Ubben was inside the main building with Mr. Stevens and Mr. Smith, the information-
management officer, when the attack,ers set it on fire around 15 minutes after the shooting started.
The three took refuge in a safe room, but found themselves overcome by smoke and agreed they would make a break
for it through a window, according to a State Department official familiar with Mr. Ubben's role.
Mr. Ubben, a 30-year-old Iraq war veteran, managed to escape, but lost contact with Messrs. Stevens and Smith in the
dense smoke, the official said.
In Washington, officials said, National Security Adviser Tom Donilon informed Mr. Obama of the attack in progress
ahead of a 5 p.m. Eastern time Oval Office meeting with Defense Secretary Leon Panetta and Gen. Martin Dempsey,
chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff. By then, the main villa in the consulate compound was on fire.
There was no serious consideration at that hour of intervening with military force, officials said. Doing so without Libya's
permission could represent a violation of sovereignty and inflame the situation, they said. Instead, the State Department
reached out to the Libyan government to get reinforcements to the scene.
The Libyans sent about two dozen security men, according to members of the reinforcement team, who arrived at the
consulate 30 minutes after the fighting had started.
In addition to the shooting, thick black smoke and flames hindered a proper search inside the consulate, an effort
further hampered by the absence of fire extinguishers and masks.
Mr. Ubben and the other security agents made several trips into the building to try to find the diplomats but could
spend only brief periods inside, and suffered varying degrees of lung damage, said the official familiar with Mr. Ubben's
role.

On one trip in, they found Mr. Smith's body and pulled it out. There was no sign of the ambassador.
The American security personnel evacuated the consulate and made their way to the secret site called the annex.
A plane with an American security team from Tripoli arrived in Benghazi about 1:30 a.m., according to the Libyan
account. The team found its way to the annex using global positioning devices. Libyans who accompanied the Americans
to the scene weren't told of the annex's location because of its connection to sensitive programs, and the Americans
didn't give them the GPS coordinates or address. Libyans at an emergency operation center in Benghazi were also kept
in the dark to the exact location.
As the U.S. and Libyan reinforcement team arrived from the airport, fighting broke out at the annex.
That assault, using rocket-propelled grenades and mortars, was described in U.S. and Libyan accounts as more
sophisticated than the earlier attack on the consulate, and it appeared to involve militants with possible links to al
Qaecla.
The Libyans led a convoy of roughly 30 Americans from the safe house to the airport, where a plane had been waiting.
But they quickly realized the plane was too small to evacuate everyone at once.
"We were surprised at the numbers of Americans who were at the airport," said Libyan Deputy Prime Minister Mustafa
Abushagour. "We figured three or four people. No one told us the numbers ahead of time."
The deputy prime minister said that he learned about the extent of U.S. intelligence operations only after the incident.
We have no problem with intelligence sharing or gathering, but our sovereignty is also key," said Mr. Abushagour.
The first to be flown to Tripoli were American diplomats and civilians. The U.S. security team waited for a second flight.
During the wait, Libyan troops went, without any Americans, to the Benghazi Medical Center to retrieve the
ambassador's body. Around 8 a.m., according to Libyan officials, the security detail flew back to Tripoli, carrying the
body.
Some officials say the U.S. could have sent military forces to Benghazi from U.S. Naval Air Station Sigonella, which is
some 450 miles away in Sicily, or mobilized a Marine team in Rota, Spain. Some officials said the U.S. could also have
sent aircraft to the scene in a "show of force" to scare off the attackers.
State Department officials dismissed the suggestions as unrealistic. "They would not have gotten there in two hours,
four hours or six hours. They don't have troops sitting in a room next to an airplane with a pilot just sitting in the next
room drinking coffee," one senior State Department official said.
Some defense officials agreed with that assessment, given limited communications to Americans on the ground during
the assault. "It was the fog of war," one said.
At the annex, Mr. Ubben suffered head and leg injuries from a mortar explosion. He was released this week from
intensive care but remains at Walter Reed National Military Medical Center, in Bethesda, Md., the State Department
official familiar with his role said.
Mr. Ubben, a Marylander, is married and has a stepdaughter and an infant son. He is conscious and able to
communicate, according to his father, Rex Ubben.
"He's in good spirits," the senior Mr. Ubben said. "They're pretty confident that he'll be able to walk again."

Libyans march against Islamist militias in Benghazi
By Peter Graff and Suleiman Al-Khalidi
BENGHAZI, Libya Fri Sep 21, 2012 2:23prn EDT
(Reuters) - Thousands of Libyans marched in Benghazi on Friday in support of democracy and against the
Islamist militias that Washington blames for an attack on the U.S. consulate last week that killed four
Americans including the ambassador.
The "Rescue Benghazi day" demonstration called for the government to disband armed groups that have refused
to give up their weapons since the NATO-backed revolution that toppled Muammar Gaddafi last year,
Marchers headed for a main square where a much smaller counter demonstration of hundreds of supporters of
hardline Islamist group Ansar al-Sharia were waiting.
"It's obvious that this protest is against the militias. All of them should join the army or security forces as
individuals, not as groups," medical student Ahmed Sanallah, 27, said. "Without that there will be no prosperity
and no success for the new Libya."
The late afternoon demonstration had a cheerful atmosphere as families marched with small children on their
shoulders.
Fighter jets and helicopters roared overhead in a show of official support for the demonstration, which has been
enthusiastically promoted by the city's authorities.
"Those military battalions that want to impose their ideology on the people of Libya will be confronted," Saleh
Gaouda, a member of new ruling national congress, said.
"This city wants to go back to stability and participate in building the state"
In a sign of the cheerful atmosphere, one ear had a giant cardboard model of Benghazi's landmark lighthouse
strapped to the roof As the sun set and the crowd began to disperse, someone shot fireworks into the air.

"DEFEND BENGHAZI"
Although the main demands of the marchers did not mention the attack on the U.S. consulate, it seems to have
provided a strong impetus for the authorities to rally support behind the country's weak government.
U.S. ambassador Christopher Stevens was well liked in Libya, and many people who were angered by an anti-
Islamic film made in the United States consider the attack on the embassy to have been excessive. Some
placards in English, intended for international news cameras, read: "We demand justice for Stevens" and "Libya
lost a friend".
"1 am out today to defend Benghazi. Killing the ambassador is a completely separate thing," 26-year-old Arnjad
Mohammed Hassan, a network engineer, said "I don't give a damn about the killing of the ambassador because
the Americans offended the Prophet. I am just here for Benghazi."
Benghazi, 1,000 km (600 miles) from Tripoli across largely empty desert, is controlled by various armed
groups, including some comprised of Islamists who openly proclaim their hostility to democratic government
and the West.
Some of these have been identified by local people as being among those who were at the consulate protest last
week. U.S. officials have described the violence as a "terrorist attack".
One group linked to the attack is Ansar al-Shatia, which has denied involvement in the violence.
Abu Al-Qaa, a demonstrator at the Ansar al-Sharia counter demonstration, said Stevens "was preparing for he
entry of American troops into Libya".
"The will of the Prophet was to expel infidels from Muslim lands so that Muslims prevail. Terrorizing your
enemy is one of Islam's tenets." ,
He said he had fought against American troops in Iraq where he was arrested and sent back to Gaddafi's Libya
and jailed for three years.
One banner at that demonstration read: "Day to rescue Benghazi or day to rescue America?"
In southern Libya, at least six people were killed and 12 injured in clashes between security forces and a local
group, a security official and a resident said on Friday.
Security forces were sent to the town of Brak, 700 km (400 miles) south of Tripoli, on Wednesday to stop a
group broadcasting songs about Craddafi on the radio, the official said The security forces, made up of former
rebel fighters, came under attack upon arrival.

militia group in Libyais eastern city of Benghazi on Friday, Reuters witnesses said.
Chanting "Libya, Libya", the demonstrators pulled down flags of the Ansar Al-Sharia militia and torched a
vehicle inside the base. There was no sign of resistance from the militia.
Earlier, protesters entered a separate compound belonging to the militia.

Associated Press
Published September 21, 2012
BENGHAZI, lli3YA — Hundreds of protesters angry over last week's killing of the U.S. ambassador to Libya stormed the
compound of the Islamic extremist militia suspected in the attack, evicting militiamen and setting fire to their building
Friday.
In an unprecedented show of public anger at Libya's rampant militias, the crowd overwhelmed the compound of the
Ansar Al-Sharlah Brigade in the center of the eastern city of Benghazi.
Ansar Al-Shariah fighters initially fired in the air to disperse the crowd, but eventually abandoned the site with their
weapons and vehicles after it was overrun by waves of protesters shouting "No to militias."
"I don't want to see armed men wearing Afghani-style clothes stopping me in the street to give me orders, I only want to
see people in uniform," said Omar Mohammed, a university student who took part in the takeover of the site, which
protesters said was done in support of the army and police.
No deaths were reported in the incident, which came after tens of thousands marched in Benghazi against armed
militias. One vehicle was also burned at the compound.
For many Libyans, the Sept. 11 attack on the U.S. Consulate in Benghazi was the last straw in one of the biggest
problems Libya has faced since the ouster and death of longtime dictator Moamrnar Qaddafi around a year ago -- the
multiple mini-armies that with their arsenals of machine guns and rocket-propelled grenades are stronger than the
regular armed forces and police.
The militias, a legacy of the rag-tag popular forces that fought Qaddafi's regime, tout themselves as protectors of Libya's
revolution, providing security where police cannot. But many say they act like gangs, detaining and intimidating rivals
and carrying out killings.
Militias made up of Islamic radicals like Ansar Al-Shariah are notorious for attacks on Muslims who don't abide by their
hardline ideology. Officials and witnesses say fighters from Ansar Al-Shariati led the attack on the U.S. consulate, which
killed Amb. Chris Stevens and three other Americans.
After taking over the Ansar compound, protesters then drove to attack the Benghazi headquarters of another Islamist
militia, Rafallah Sahati. The militiamen opened fire on the protesters, who were largely unarmed. At least 20 were
wounded, and there were unconfirmed witness reports of three protesters killed.
Earlier in the day, some 30,000 people filled a broad boulevard as they marched along a lake in central Benghazi on
Friday to the gates of the headquarters of Ansar Al-Shariah.
"No, no, to militias," the crowd chanted, filling a broad boulevard. They carried banners and signs demanding that
militias disband and that the government build up police to take their place in keeping security. "Benghazi is in a trap,"
signs read. "Where is the army, where is the police?"

Other signs mourned the killing of Stevens, reading, "The ambassador was Libya's friend" and "Libya lost a friend."
Military helicopters and fighter jets flew overhead, and police mingled in the crowd, buoyed by the support of the
protesters.
The march was the biggest seen in Benghazi, Libya's second largest city and home to 1 million people, since the fall of
Qaddafi in August 2011. The public backlash comes in part in frustration with the interim government, which has been
unable to rein in the armed factions. Many say that officials' attempts to co-opt fighters by paying them have only fueled
the growth of militias without bringing them under state control or integrating them into the regular forces.
Residents of another main eastern city, Darna, have also begun to stand up against Ansar Al-Shariah and other militias.
The anti-militia fervor in Darna is notable because the city, in the mountains along the Mediterranean coast north of
Benghazi, has long had a reputation as a stronghold for Islamic extremists. During the Qaddafi era, it was the hotbed of a
deadly Islamist insurgency against his regime.
A significant number of the Libyan jihadists who travelled to Afghanistan and Iraq during recent wars came from Darna.
During the revolt against him last year, Qaddafi's regime warned that Darna would declare itself an Islamic Emirate and
ally itself with Al Qaeda.
But now, the residents are lashing out against Ansar Al-Shariah, the main Islamic extremist group in the city.
"The killing of the ambassador blew up the situation. It was disastrous," said Ayoub al-Shedwi, a young bearded Muslim
preacher in Darna who says he has received multiple death threats because has spoken out against militias on a radio
show he hosts. "We felt that the revolution is going in vain."
Leaders of tribes, which are the strongest social force in eastern Libya, have come forward to demand that the militias
disband.
Tribal leaders in Benghazi and Darna announced this week that members of their tribes who are militiamen will no
longer have their protection in the face of anti-militia protests. That means the tribe will not avenge them if they are
killed.
Activists and residents have held a sit-in for the past eight days outside Darna's Sahaba Mosque, calling on tribes to put
an end to the "state of terrorism" created by the militias.
Militiamen have been blamed for a range of violence in Darna. On the same day Stevens killed in Benghazi, a number of
elderly Catholic nuns and a priest who have lived in Darna for decades providing free medical services, were attacked,
reportedly beaten or stabbed. There have been 32 killings over the past few months, including the city security chief and
assassinations of former officers from Qaddafi's military.
Darna's residents are conservative, but they largely don't fit the city's reputation as extremists.
Women wear headscarves, but not the more conservative black garb and veil that covers the entire body and face. In
the ancient city's narrow alleys, shops display sleeveless women dresses and the young men racing by in cars blare
Western songs.
And many are impatient with Ansar Al-Sharjah's talk of imposing its strict version of Islamic law. The group's name
means "Supporters of Shariah Law."
"We are not infidels for God sake, We have no bars, no discos, we are not practicing vice in the street," said Wassam ben
Madin, a leading activist in the city who lost his right eye in clashes with security forces on the first day of the uprising
against Qaddafi. "This is not the time for talk about Sharjah. Have a state first then talk to me about Sharjah."

"If they are the 'supporters of Sharjah' then who are we?" he said. "We don't want the flag of Al Qaeda raised over
heads," he added, referring to Ansar Al-Shariah's black banner.
One elder resident at the Sahaba Mosque sit-in, Ramadan Yousset said, "We will talk to them peacefully. We will tell
them you are from us and you fought for us" during the civil war against Qaddafi. But 'if you say no (to integrating into
the) police and army, we will storm your place. It's over."
Officials in the interim government and security forces say they are not strong enough to crack down on the militias. The
armed factions have refused government calls for them to join the regular army and police.
So the government has created a "High Security Committee" aimed at grouping the armed factions as a first step to
integration, Authorities pay fighters a salary of as much as 1,000 dinars, around $900, to join -- compared to the average
police monthly salary of around $200.
However, the militias that join still do not abide by government authority, and critics say the lure of salaries has only
prompted more militias to form.
Officials and former rebel commanders estimate the number of rebels that actually fought in the 8-month civil war
against Gadhafi at around 30,000. But those now listed on the High Security Committee payroll have reached several
hundred thousand.
"All these militia and entities are fake ones but it is mushrooming," said Khaled Hadar, a Benghazi-based lawyer. 'The
government is only making temporarily solutions, but you are creating a disaster."

Re: Latest Libyan Leadership Private Discussions & Plans
SOURCE: Sources with direct access to the Libyan National Transitional Council, as well as the
highest levels of European Governments, and Western Intelligence and security services.
1. During mid-October 2012 Libyan President Yussef el Magariaf stated in private that he and
Prime Minister Ali Zidan have ordered National Libyan Aimy (NLA) Chief of Staff General Youssef al
Mangoush to establish a more coordinated operational relationship with Misrata and Zintan militias
in order to support expanded army operations throughout the country. According to a sensitive
source, prior to the death of the United States Ambassador on September 11, 2012 Mangoush resisted
greater reliance on these specific large militias believing that such a move undercuts the
government's efforts to disarm and demobilize all of the militias left over from the 2011civil war. At
this point, however, Mangoush agreed with Magariaf that the situation in the country is becoming
increasingly dangerous and unmanageable. Accordingly, the Chief of Staff stated that he will work
with Ousama al Jouwali, the leader of the Zintan forces to step up operations against the other
militias, (supported by the Misrata troops), that also come from the mountainous region of Western
Libya. At the same time he will instruct NLA troops under ground force commander General IChalifa
Belqasirn Haftar to pursue operations against tribal forces fighting on behalf of the Qaddafi family in
Southern and Southeastern Libya

2. (Source Comment: In the opinion of this individual, Magariaf and Zidan agree that Libya's
future depends on the success of their efforts in this militia demobilization operation over the next six
months. While they believe that the involvement of Ansar al Sharia forces, with the assistance of al
Qai'da in the Islamic Magreb (AQIM), in the assassination of the U.S. Ambassador has focused the
world business and diplomatic community on the reality of the security issues surrounding the
militias, the President and Prime Minister also fear that the situation is far worse than Western
sources realize. Mangoush informs them that AQIM and radical Sala.fist groups are increasing their
efforts to take advantage of the frustrations of the various militias with the government, using the
attack on the U.S. Consulate in Benghazi as an inspiration for their activities. Just as Ansar at Sharia
began as a militia supporting the federalist claims of Eastern tribal leaders, and was then infiltrated
by AQIM radicals, Mangoush believes many of the other regional and ethnic militias around the
country could follow the same path, if his troops do not succeed in the disarmament program. He
also agrees with Zidan that they must move quickly since Libya's tradition of avoiding the Sunni-Shia
conflict that dominates most of Middle East is beginning to erode during this period of chaos.)
3. A particularly sensitive source noted that NLA operations have already begun against Ansar
at Sharia forces south of Benghazi, after members of that militia/terrorist group killed four national
policemen during a grenade attack at a roadblock in the Sousa Mountains. Under orders from Haftar
Libyan troops surrounded more than 100 Ansar al Sharia fighters in the region of the town of Sousa.
According to this sensitive source, the NLA. suffered relatively heavy casualties in the fighting, but
believe they captured a number of AQIM operatives and one of Ansar at Shaaia's senior commanders,
Sufian bin Qamu, who they believe ordered the attack on the police. Mangoush also reported to Zidan
that Qamu had been previously captured by United States forces and imprisoned at the Guantanamo
Bay facility.
4. At the same time the Libyan army and forces from the Misrata militia entered the town of
Bani Walid approximately mot miles south of Tripoli, in an area still loyal to the Qaddafi family,
engaging in close fighting with pro-Qadclafi forces. During the fighting Haftar dispatched troops with
heavier arms to support the Misrata forces. According to this source, the NTLA downplayed the level of
the fighting, in an effort to reassure the supporters of the Government. That said the NLA/Misrata
force had captured the city center and the airport after suffering significant casualties. The
Government forces entered the city after shelling opposition positions around the city hospital, using
heavy mortars and motorized guns.
5. (Source Comment: In the opinion of this knowledgeable individual, while Magariaf and
Zidan remain optimistic about the future of Libya, they believe that the security situation will remain
tenuous throughout 2013. Magariaf also sees the national election scheduled for mid-2013 as a
potentially complicating factor. According to this source, Mangoush and Haftar focused on Rani
Walid under pressure from the Misrata commanders. These militia leaders were, according to a
knowledgeable source, angered over the death of one of their senior officials, Omran Shaban, at the
hands of pro-Qaddafi forces in Bani Walid. The Misrata commanders report that Shaban was one of
the organizers of the Misrata militia unit that captured and executed Qadclafi in 2011 outside of the
town of Sirte. The Misrata leaders, supported by the General National Council (GNC), demanded the
surrender of the men who arrested and killed Shaban. As the fighting expanded through late
September and early October, Magariaf and his advisors came to see Bani Walid as an important
symbol of their commitment to disarm the militias and anti-government groups, and increased their
involvement accordingly.)

1. During mid-October 2012 Libyan President Yussef el Magariaf stated in private that he and
Piime Minister Ali Zidan have ordered National Libyan Army (NIA) Chief of Staff General Youssef al
Mangoush to establish a more coordinated operational relationship with Misrata and Zintan militias
in order to support expanded army operations throughout the country. According to a sensitive
source, prior to the death of the United States Ambassador on September 11, 2012 Mangoush resisted
greater reliance on these specific large militias, believing that such a move undercuts the
government's efforts to disarm and demobilize all of the militias left over from the 2011 civil war. At
this point, however, Mangoush agreed with Magariaf that the situation in the country is becoming
increasingly dangerous and unmanageable. Accordingly, the Chief of Staff stated that he will work
with Ousama al Jouwali, the leader of the Zintan forces to step up operations against the other
militias, (supported by the Misrata troops), that also come from the mountainous region of Western
Libya. At the same time he will instruct NLA troops under ground force commander General Khalifa
Belgasina Haftar to pursue operations against tribal forces fighting on behalf of the Qaddafi family in
Southern and Southeastern Libya.

2- (Source Comment: In the opinion of this individual, Magariaf and Zidan agree that Libya's
future depends on the success of their efforts in this militia demobilization operation over the next six
months. While they believe that the involvement of Ansar al Sharia forces, with the assistance of al
Qafda in the Islamic Magreb (AQIM), in the assassination of the U.S. Ambassador has focused the
world business and diplomatic community on the reality of the security issues surrounding the
militias, the President and Prime Minister also fear that the situation is far worse than Western
sources realize. Mangoush informs them that AQIM and radical Salafist groups are increasing their
efforts to take advantage of the frustrations of the various militias with the government, using the
attack on the U.S. Consulate in Benghazi as an inspiration for their activities. Just as Amax al Sharia
began as a militia supporting the federalist claims of Eastern tribal leaders, and was then infiltrated
by NEVI radicals, Mangoush believes many of the other regional and ethnic militias around the
country could follow the same path, if his troops do not succeed in the disarmament program. Be
also agrees with Zidan that they must move quickly since Libya's tradition of avoiding the Sunni-Shia
conflict that dominates most of Middle East is beginning to erode during this period of chaos.)
3. A particularly sensitive source noted that NLA operations have already begun against Ansar
al Sharia forces south of Benghazi, after members of that militia/terrorist group killed four national
policemen during a grenade attack at a roadblock in the Sousa Mountains. Under orders from Haftar
Libyan troops surrounded more than 100 Ansar al Sharia fighters in the region of the town of Sousa.
According to this sensitive source, the NIA suffered relatively heavy casualties in the fighting, but
believe they captured a number of AQIM operatives and one of Ansar al Sharia's senior commanders,
Sufian bin Qamu, who they believe ordered the attack on the police. Mangoush also reported to Zidan
that Qamu had been previously captured by United States forces and imprisoned at the Guantanamo
Bay facility.
4. At the same time the Libyan army and forces from the Misrata militia entered the town of
Bani Walid approximately 100 miles south of Tripoli, in an area still loyal to the Qaddafi family,
engaging in close fighting with pro-Qaddafi forces. During the fighting Haftar dispatched troops with
heavier arms to support the Misrata forces. According to this source, the NLA downplayed the level of
the fighting, in an effort to reassure the supporters of the Government. That said the NLA/Misrata

The Other Embassy Attack
Wall Street Journal Review & Outlook
Friday, October 26, 2012, 6:43 p.m. EDT
Tehran tries to turn Yemen into another Lebanon.
Government emails from Libya released this week show Foggy Bottom's finest knew within hours that an Islamist terror
group was behind the September 11 attacks that killed four Americans. Maybe this truth drip will force President Obama
to explain why his Administration so strenuously downplayed a terrorist connection and insisted an anti-Islamic video
was to blame. But amid media and Congressional efforts to uncover the truth about Benghazi, it's worth paying
attention to another attack on a U.S. diplomatic mission last month.
On September 13, several hundred people, mostly young men, stormed the Embassy in Yemen's capital of Sanaa. The
American staff had been evacuated, but the compound was overrun. In the melee four Yemenis died. At the time the
event was lumped in with other anti-American protests in Tunisia, Pakistan and Egypt that week.
Yet it has since become clear that the Yemen assault was also well coordinated, likely by one or more militias. More
alarming is an Iranian connection that signals that Tehran is expanding its long and quiet war on America to a new front.
The U.S. isn't ruling out the possible complicity of a Yemeni army faction loyal to ousted President Ali Abdullah Saleh. He
stepped down from power in February as part of a U.S.-backed political transition. Since his departure, the military has
been divided amid jockeying for control in this tribal society. The Salehs deny the accusation.
During months of anti-government protests in 2011, al Qaeda in the Arabian Peninsula (AQAP) also gained control of
territory in central Yemen. The group has several times tried to strike the U.S. mainland, and it may have been behind
the assassination this month of a Yemeni security officer employed at the U.S. Embassy.
However, the leading culprit is a Shiite rebel force backed by Tehran. Taking their name from a deceased commander,
the Houthi militia have since the mid-1990s fought against the Sunni-dominated government in Sanaa. According to
Western officials in Yemen, Iran has provided assistance for a Houthi resurgence in the past year Their fighters have
gone to Iran and Lebanon for training, and money and arms have flowed from both into Yemen, officials say. The
Houthis run a satellite TV channel, al-Maseera, from Beirut.
In July the Yemeni government said it had uncovered an Iranian spy ring in Sanaa. That got the attention of the Saudis,
who are anxious about Iranian efforts to stir up their co-religionist Shiites in Bahrain, Yemen and most of all in the
Kingdom itself.

Tehran's strategy in Yemen calls to mind Lebanon in the 1980s, when Iran built up Hezbollah into what has become the
leading political power in Lebanon. The Iran-backed terrorists burst onto the scene by bombing the U.S. embassy and
Marine barracks in Beirut. If the Houthis were in the lead last month, the command and control chain runs straight to
Tehran.
The interim Yemeni government is also grappling with a separatist armed uprising in the south. One of the leaders of the
fractured rebel force lives in Beirut and has tried to build a pro-Iran movement in the south, according to a Western
diplomat in Sanaa.
The Houthis and the southerners are separate groups with somewhat different agendas. But Iran may be facilitating a
partnership, as well as reaching out to al Qaeda. They have one goal in common: To bring down the pro-American
government in Sanaa. "Despite the fact that they're on opposite ends of the religious spectrum, al Qaeda and Iran will
cooperate," a Western diplomat says. "You see indications that Iran is helping al Qaeda by trying to forge relations
between AQAP, Houthis and southern rebels."
The U.S. supports a "national dialogue" to stabilize Yemen, while waging a drone campaign against the AQAP. Both are
commendable goals. Yet Tehran has emerged as a new threat to Yemen's future and is fighting the U.S. through terror
proxies. Congress can seek more clarity about Iran's designs with an inquiry into the Sanaa attacks.

Jake I was so moved by Hillary's powerful presence today on the screen as I watched along with millions in America
and around the world. She was emphathetic and unflinching and inspiring; she was wise and steady and strong. My 80

Subject: Quick readout from Jeff Feitman in Tried
Jeff asked me to pass along the following readout. Please excuse the free-form list of subjects but I wanted to get this
out quickly to as wide an audience as possible. Please feel free to share with others I've missed.
1. State of Embassy Tripoli facility: While admitting he is no engineer, Jeff agrees with the initial OBO assessment
that the facility is not salvageable — the condition is "shocking and photos doesn't do it justice.' Floors have
collapsed, the ballistic glass and metal support beams have melted, and it has been totally trashed. Jeff asked
for their help on Embassy security; they took this on board but noted that they are still in the process of trying to
secure the country.
2. Abdel JAI and Mahmoud fibril both to NY next week: Both will travel to NY next week for the high level
meeting on the 20th. Jain will then return to Libya, and Jibril will remain in NY to deliver the Libyan address to
UNGA on the 24th. The plan is to have the new cabinet in place by the 2e,with Jibril the likely PM. Jeff pressed
them on including a woman on their UN delegation. He also made all of the points about the need for the INC
to take the lead in NY in outlining what they are seeking from the int'l community but they didn't share their
ideas about what they will say.
Action needed: Jalil needs a visa,
understand MAG is working this now but we will need to facilitate issuance (likely by Embassy Tunis).
1 Saadi Qadhafl and Niger: Jibril has sent a letter to Niamey and is sending the Deputy FM there to talk about
Saadi. The Libyan request to Niger will be two-fold: 1. Detain him properly (they understand he is free to roam
about 2. Be prepared to return him to Libya to stand trial.
4. Weapons issues: They will ask OPCW to come back and they want them to say yes but the Libyans are picking
up noises from OPCW that they can't accept a request from the INC now because the INC is not a UN
member. (comment: I know the credentials issue is being worked this week in NY but Ken Ward please convey
to OPCW that they need to take the Libyans up on their request asap.)
S. OUP mandate: they think NATO should stay beyond an additional 30 days (I told Jeff I thought we were now
looking at 90 in any case).
6. Pan Am 103: Jeff raised the issue with Jaill and the Justice Minister, which they took on board; Justice Minister
said "this was a crime against humanity so Libya has to cooperate."
7. Treatment of Libyans of color and African migrants: Jeff raised and they responded with the right things.
8. Oil fund paper: Passed to INC.
9. "Boots on the ground": they asked about the comments they had seen and expressed their concern over
them. Jeff explained that these were people to help provide security for our people and facility and why they
were necessary.

today. I was with some NEA hands who knew Chris well and they all noted the Secretary's visit to their offices earlier in
the week and how pitch-perfect this has been handled. The remarks today were beautiful and moving. I did not have a
personal connection to the four lost this week but the President and Secretary seemed to be speaking as well to those I
did know and still mourn. So I wanted to write to say thank you. This is among the most challenging and uncertain
periods in our history — and our nation is more fortunate than it knows to have such a steady team at the helm,

Re: Libyan leadership and militias
SOURCE: Sources with direct access to the Libyan National Transitional Council, as well as the
highest levels of European Governments, and Western Intelligence and security services.
1. During the last week of December 2011, and the first week of 2012, Libya's Prime Minister
Abdurrahim el-Keib and President Mustafa Abdul Jail engaged in a series of emergency planning
meetings attempting to deal with specific issues threatening the stability of the new National
Transitional Council (NTC) Government. According to extremely sensitive sources speaking in strict
confidence, paramount among these issues are the questions of disarming and rewarding the regional
militias who bore the majority of the fighting against the regime of Muaimnar al Qaddafi, as well as
the related issue of finding ministers and senior administrators for the new government who are
acceptable to these revolutionary forces. These individuals noted that on four occasions, beginning on
December 23, 2011, groups or angry militiamen came to el-Keib's office and demanded better
treatment, a clear message of support for the role of Islamic law, and the removal of former Qaddafi
advisors from the new government.
2. (Source Comment: In the opinion of a very sensitive source, el-Keib is genuinely concerned
that this situation could spiral out of control and threatens the regime. He also suspects that much of
the unrest is being stirred by General Abdel Hakim Alamin Belhaj and his conservative Islamist
supporters. By staying out of the new government, Belhaj has established a position from which he
can criticize their actions and appointments without concern or control,. That said, el — Keib has been

told by his contacts in the Moslem Brotherhood (MB) that even Belhaj has been surprised that the
unrest in the militias has begun to manifest itself in fighting between groups that previously shared
the same goals and operated under Belhars loose command. This is particularly true in the case of
the increasingly violent conflicts between the Misrata and Zintan regional militias.)
3. In an effort to address these problems el-Keib is making changes in his new administration,
removing Minister of Economics Taher Sherkaz, who, as a former economic advisor to Qaddafi, was a
particular target of the militiamen. In the opinion of well informed individuals, el-Keib's closest and
most influential advisors are experts with economic backgrounds and experience dealing with
Western firms and governments. The most influential of this group are Minister of Oil Abdulrahman
Ben Yezza, Minister of Finance Hassan Ziglam, National Oil Company chief Nuni Berrusien, and Nge,b
Obeda from the Libyan Stock Exchange.
4. (Source Comment: In the opinion of a very sensitive source, el-Keib and Jail are also very
concerned over growing criticism that these technocrats are puppets of various Western governments
and firms. Belhaj and the militiamen appear intent on limiting the influence of these Western
entities, using them as a weapon to weaken the el-Keib regime. This trend is also affecting national
security, where, despite el-Keib's efforts to maintain a balance between the Islamists, regional
commanders, and the national army, a potentially dangerous conflict has arisen over the position of
Chief of Staff of the National Army. El-Kieb, according to this individual, believes that he must settle
this matter in short order to avoid provoking security concerns among foreign allies and businesses
contacts.)
5. According to a knowledgeable individual, in late December 2011e1-Kieb resisted efforts by
General Khalifa Belqasim Haftar to establish himself as the Chief of Staff of the National Army.
Haftar, who lived in the United States for many years and is believed by Belhaj and others to have a
relationship with the U.S. Government, is using his popularity among the officer corps of the regular
NTC army to support his claim to be Chief of Staff. This produced heated protests from militia
leaders and in late December 20liel-Keib named deputy Minister of Defense Colonel Yussef al-
Mangoush, to be Chief of Staff. In the opinion of one source, this is a problematic choice, since el-
Keit) is replacing the supposedly pro-American Haftar with al-Mangoush who commanded one of
Qaddafi's elite Special Forces units, even after the revolution began. This individual believes that el-
Keib's decision was driven by personal animosity toward Haftar, and the influence of Minister of
Defense Osama al-Juwali. The situation is far from resolved, as Haftar and his supporters,
particularly in the Benghazi garrison, continue to claim that the General is the true Chief of Staff. El-
Keib and al-Juwali are working to reconcile all of the elements in this conflict as quickly as possible,
before the supporters of the two claimants begin fighting. In the meantime, el-Keib has stated in
private that he fully expects Belhaj to attack al-Mangoush, but the Prime Minister believes that the
Colonel is the only officer strong enough to disarm the militias and avoid a civil war.
6. At the same time, a very sensitive source added that el-Keib and Jalil are attempting to
reconcile the fighting between Misrata and Zintan forces in Tripoli by naming Misrata leader Fawzi
Abd All as Minister of the Interior and al-Juwali, who was commander of the Zintan militia, as
Minister of Defense. To date, according to this individual, this effort has met with limited success, as
the fighting has continued and the militias are refusing to disarm until their demands regarding living
standards are met.
7, (Source Comment: One very sensitive source noted, that el-Keib is aware of the fact that he
is running out of time to stabilize the situation in Libya. He believes that if he does not disarm the
militias and meet their demands in the next six months there is a good chance of increased fighting
among rival groups that could lead to civil war. In any event, he realizes that the ongoing instability
will cause Western governments, firms, and banks, to hesitate before committing themselves to long
term relationships with Libya. El-Keil3 believes that Belhaj and his advisors have made the same
judgment, and are waiting to fill any vacuum created by this violence, by establishing a conservative
Islamic Republic.)

7. (Source Comment: One very sensitive source noted, that el-Keib is aware of the fact
that he is running out of time to stabilize the situation in Libya. He believes that if he does not
disarm the militias and meet their demands in the next six months there is a good chance of
increased fighting among rival groups that could lead to civil war. In any event, he realizes that
the ongoing instability will cause Western governments, firms, and banks, to hesitate before
committing themselves to long term relationships with Libya. El-Keib believes that Belhaj and
his advisors have made the same judgment, and are waiting to fill any vacuum created by this
violence, by establishing a conservative Islamic Republic.)

Re: Libyan leadership and militias
SOURCE: Sources with direct access to the Libyan National Transitional Council, as well as the
highest levels of European Governments, and Western Intelligence and security services.
1. During the last week of December 2011 and the first week of 2012, Libya's Prime Minister
Abdurrahim el-Keib and President Mustafa Abdul Ja.lil engaged in a series of emergency planning
meetings attempting to deal with specific issues threatening the stability of the new National
Transitional Council (NTC) Government. According to extremely sensitive sources speaking in strict
confidence, paramount among these issues are the questions of disarming and rewarding the regional
militias who bore the majority of the fighting against the regime of Muammar al Qaddafi, as well as
the related issue of finding ministers and senior administrators for the new government who are
acceptable to these revolutionary forces. These individuals noted that on four occasions, beginning on
December 23, 2011, groups or angry militiamen came to el-Keib's office and demanded better

treatment, a clear message of support for the role of Islamic law, and the removal of former Qaddafl
advisors from the new government.
2. (Source Comment: In the opinion of a very sensitive source, el-Keib is genuinely concerned
that this situation could spiral out of control and threatens the regime. He also suspects that much of
the unrest is being stirred by General Abdel Hakim Alamin Belhaj and his conservative Islamist
supporters. By staying out of the new government, Belhaj has established a position from which he
can criticize their actions and appointments without concern or control. That said, el — Keib has been
told by his contacts in the Moslem Brotherhood (MB) that even Belhaj has been surprised that the
unrest in the militias has begun to manifest itself in fighting between groups that previously shared
the same goals and operated under Belhaj's loose command. This is particularly true in the case of
the increasingly violent conflicts between the Misrata and Zintan regional militias.)
3. In an effort to address these problems el-Keib is making changes in his new administration,
removing Minister of Economics Taher Sherkaz, who, as a former economic advisor to Qaddafi, was a
particular target of the militiamen. In the opinion of well informed individuals, el-Keib's closest and
most influential advisors are experts with economic backgrounds and experience dealing with
Western firms and governments. The most influential of this group are Minister of Oil Abdulrahman
Ben Yezza, Minister of Finance Hassan Ziglarn, National Oil Company chief Nuni Berrusien, and Ngeb
Obeda from the Libyan Stock Exchange.
4. (Source Comment: In the opinion of a very sensitive source, el-Keib and JAE are also very
concerned over growing criticism that these technocrats are puppets of various Western governments
and firms. Belhaj and the militiamen appear intent on limiting the influence of these Western
entities, using them as a weapon to weaken the el-Keib regime. This trend is also affecting national
security, where, despite el-Keib's efforts to maintain a balance between the Islamists, regional
commanders, and the national army, a potentially dangerous conflict has arisen over the position of
Chief of Staff of the National Army. El-Kieb, according to this individual, believes that he must settle
this matter in short order to avoid provoking security concerns among foreign allies and businesses
contacts.)
5. According to a knowledgeable individual, in late December 2011e1-Kieb resisted efforts by
General Khalith Belqasim Haftar to establish himself as the Chief of Staff of the National Army.
Haftar, who lived in the United States for many years and is believed by Belhaj and others to have a
relationship with the U.S. Government, is using his popularity among the officer corps of the regular
mrcarmy to support his claim to be Chief of Staff. This produced heated protests from militia
leaders and in late December 2011e1-Keib named deputy Minister of Defense Colonel Yussef al-
Mangoush, to be Chief of Staff. In the opinion of one source, this is a problematic choice, since el-
Keib is replacing the supposedly pro-American Haftar with al-Mangoush who commanded one of
Qaddafi's elite Special Forces units, even after the revolution began. This individual believes that el-
Keib's decision was driven by personal animosity toward Haftar, and the influence of Minister of
Defense Osama al-Juwali. The situation is far from resolved, as Haftar and his supporters,
particularly in the Benghazi garrison, continue to claim that the General is the true Chief of Staff. El-
Keib and al-Juwali are working to reconcile all of the elements in this conflict as quickly as possible,
before the supporters of the two claimants begin fighting. In the meantime, el-Keib has stated in
private that he fully expects Belhaj to attack al-Mangoush, but the Prime Minister believes that the
Colonel is the only officer strong enough to disarm the militias and avoid a civil war.
6. At the same time, a very sensitive source added that el-Keib and Jain are attempting to
reconcile the fighting between Misrata and Zintan forces in Tripoli by naming Misrata leader Favvzi
Abd Ali as Minister of the Interior and al-Juwali, who was commander of the Zintan militia, as
Minister of Defense. To date, according to this individual, this effort has met with limited success, as
the fighting has continued and the militias are refusing to disarm until their demands regarding living
standards are met.
7. (Source Comment: One very sensitive source noted, that el-Keib is aware of the fact that he
is running out of time to stabilize the situation in Libya. He believes that if he does not disarm the
militias and meet their demands in the next six months there is a good chance of increased fighting

Op-Ed
The world after Petraeus
Obama should seize this chance to adjust his foreign policy.
By Sarah Chayes
November 15, 2012
The scandal enveloping members of America's adulated top brass is the deepest crisis to hit the military in
decades. It is a crisis President Obama did not need — shaming the country and increasing his burden during a
major transition on his national security team. And yet, crisis can be a great corrective. Obama should use this
one to reverse one of the most dysfunctional elements of U.S. foreign policy over the last decade: an infatuation
with military solutions to problems that are fundamentally political.
The resignation of former Central Intelligence Agency Director David H. Petraeus after an extramarital affair
came to light, together with expected high-level personnel changes at the State Department and other agencies,
creates a singular opportunity to embark on the complex process of rebalancing U.S. foreign policy in favor of
non-military approaches.
When he first came to office, Obama seemed suspicious of Petraeus, who made his reputation under President
George W. Bush as the general who transformed the military's approach to the Iraq war. The suspicion was
reflected in the fraught National Security Council debate over Afghanistan strategy in 2009. Yet since then,
Obama, like so many others, seems to have been seduced by Petraeus. Not by the man but by what the man
could offer him.
Petraeuss unique political genius over the last decade has been to provide each of two contrasting presidents a
military solution to his key national security problems that was tailored to his character. For Bush, obsessed
with Iraq and with leaving a mark on the Middle East, Petraeus helped design a grandiose, troop-heavy
approach.
With the change of administrations, Petraeus soon saw that Obama and his team were different — concerned
about the costs of the inherited wars and about the risks of a runaway military. So while Petraeus continued to
pay lip-service to counterinsurgency doctrine, he veered away from it in practice. His focus as commander of

the troops in Afghanistan — and even more so at the CIA — was on a type of warfare better suited to this
president: targeted, technologically advanced, secretive killing over which the president could exert control.
But such an approach, though cheaper in resources and American lives, is still flawed. It is still a military
answer to problems that are deeply political in nature and rooted in a complex mix of history, regional and
cultural particularism, and the effects of a protracted abuse of power by elites. By shifting to drones and special
ops as the instruments of choice to combat militant extremism, the U.S. government remains consumed by the
same old questions: How many men and women in uniform, equipped with what kind of hardware, need to
employ which tactics to defeat the enemy?
What atrophied during the years that two U.S. administrations dwelt obsessively on these questions were all the
other tools of U.S. foreign policy, including information-gathering and analysis, diplomacy and economic and
legal leverage.
Perhaps the gravest consequence has been the knowledge deficit. Both wars were hampered by a devastating
lack of situational understanding. In Afghanistan, where I lived and worked for more than eight years, I was
stunned by how long it took U.S. officials to realize that tribes were key to Afghan social structure. U.S.
officials resisted meeting with ordinary Afghans, dealing instead with members of a self-serving and unpopular
government. So, for more than a decade, the U.S. government was operating almost blind.
The first way Obama can constructively harness Petraeus downfall is to reorient the CIA toward its core
function: intelligence-gathering. Of late, a body-count culture has prevailed at the CIA, exemplified by the
secretive drone campaign. If 60 intelligence professionals are assigned to planning and monitoring each drone
in the air, as has been reported, that's 60 who are not on the ground in country, interacting with locals, gaining
an intuitive feel for the dynamics. Obama should resist the temptation to put another target-focused operator at
the helm of the CIA.
Another main civilian component of U.S. power is its diplomacy. Obama should also use this moment of
transition to think through what kind of State Department he really needs. The instruments of U.S. foreign
policy are multiple, varied and subtle in their application. To avail itself of them, the government needs smart,
adaptable, dynamic risk-takers, who think strategically and operate with autonomy. Such people must be
attracted to government service and provided responsibilities commensurate with their talents.
But the other national security topic of the moment threatens to push Obama in the wrong direction. The death
of Ambassador J. Christopher Stevens in Benghazi, Libya, has been politicized in deeply counterproductive
ways. Members of Congress should bear that in mind as they continue examining the details of the attack.
Stevens was exactly the type of diplomat the U.S. government needs: someone with long experience in the
region to which he was posted, an ambassador who engaged with people, gained insight into the environment
and helped influence it. That kind of diplomacy is essential, but it carries risks. If it becomes politically
untenable in Washington for an ambassador to die in the line of duty, then talented diplomats will be hobbled.
And faced with a choked career path, the best will look elsewhere for rewarding work. Obama should appoint a
secretary of State determined to counteract the tendency to retrench.
Perhaps the most important foreign policy challenge Obama faces in his second term is how to expand,
restructure and reinforce the range of civilian instruments of U.S. power. That is a generational task, but one the
current crisis has provided an unparalleled opportunity to tackle.

Subject: RE: HRC friend
jeff thanks for reminding me. The Al-Keeb government is clearly facing many crises, the major one being the inability so
far to implement what appeared to be fairly detailed plans by Minister of Interior Fauzi and Minister of Defense Juwaili to
incorporate 25k thuwar each (total 75k) into the security forces, armed forces and into the private sector (jobs, training,
education). the main obstacles appear to be inability to implement plans by any of the GOL ministers so far and lack of
funds although we hope there will be a solution to that soon. Also, none of the militias appears willing to budge without
seeing some proof that others are also willing to do so.
I am not sure about HRC contact ascribing these problems mainly to Bel-Haj, whose star we believed had fallen over the
past several weeks. The Islamists are demanding their share of the political pie like everyone else-no more and no less. I
met with a Libyan contact yesterday who had just met with an Islamist-led militiaman from Zintan. The leader of this group
demanded that women's role be inscribed in the constitution as per Sharia'-if that did not happen this guy threatened to
take up arms again. Sarkis-the new but now deposed Economy Minister is an example of the power of the street and
different voices clamoring for different things. He was a technocrat whom we dealt with in the past but because of the
perception that he was "part of the old regime" he had to go even though al-Keeb regretted the decision since Sarkis was
an able technocrat. So, the bottom line is that the disarming and reintegration of the militias is not going as well as we
would have liked though the Minister of Interior told me on the margins of the PM discussion with DDCI Morrell today that
things on that score were going "well." One positive ray of light is that Tripoli Local Council reps told us today that they
had begun registering thuwar to determine which of the three possible categories they couid stream into. Another
disturbing tmed which may be happening is the emergence of organized crime perhaps fueled by old regime elements
including Snussi and al-Baghdadi. According to MOI sources have expressed real concern about an unholy
alliance of former Qadhafi loyalists, criminals who escaped from prison, and odd assortments of different thuwar. They are
apparently getting money, terrorizing the cities by night and engaging in human trafficking, drugs, gunrunning and alcohol
backed by old regime money. The motivation would be economic and political (creating chaos and undermining
stability). Our Legatt reps will meet with the e the Brits tomorrow to see if we can respond to MOI request for help in
training a team to deal with this possible new and troubling phenomenon. Not sure whether this crime phenomenon is
connected to the murder of my good friend Hugo deSamie, a french businessman who had been involved in deals with
the old regime and was back trying his hand with the new group.
It is not clear whether he will survive given the
intense pressure the PM is coming under from the eastern Obeidi tribes-they want one of theirs in the position as
compensation for the murder of Yusuf Obeidi.
So bottom line, there is ferment and things are not progressing as fast and as far as we would like. But let's not panic yet-
the PM is well-intentioned and the ministers are able people if they can get the means to implement their plans. I told the
PM today that we could help in various areas and that we could be as discrete as need be in light of his formidable
political vulnerabilities. By the way, he may be planning to visit Washington and NY end of January-ealry February period.

Subject: MRC friend
Another friend of HliC's offers the following assessment/report from a source. HRC interested in your views.
SOURCE: Sources with direct access to the Libyan National Transitional Council, as well as the highest levels
of European Governments, and Western Intelligence and security services.
1. During the last is of December 2011, and the first week of 2012, Libya's Prime Minister
Abdurrahim el-Keib and President Mustafa Abdul Jail engaged in a series of emergency planning meetings
attempting to deal with specific issues threatening the stability of the new National Transitional Council (NTC)
Government According to extremely sensitive sources speaking in strict confidence, paramount among these
issues are the questions of disarming and rewarding the regional militias who bore the majority of the fighting
against the regime of Muammar al Qaddafi, as well as the related issue of finding ministers and senior
administrators for the new government who are acceptable to these revolutionary forces. These individuals
noted that on four occasions, beginning on December 23, 2011, groups or angry militiamen came to el-Keib's
office and demanded better treatment, a clear message of support for the role of Islamic law, and the removal
of former Qaddafi advisors from the new government.
2. (Source Comment In the opinion of a very sensitive source, el-Keib is genuinely concerned that this
situation could spiral out of control and threatens the regime. He also suspects that much of the unrest is being
stirred by General Abdel Hakim Alamin Belhaj and his conservative Islamist supporters By staying out of the
new government, Belhaj has established a position from which he can criticize their actions and appointments
without concern or control. That said, el — Keib has been told by his contacts in the Moslem Brotherhood (MB)
that even Belhaj has been surprised that the unrest in the militias has begun to manifest itself in fighting
between groups that previously shared the same goals and operated under Belhars loose command. This is
particularly true in the case of the increasingly violent conflicts between the Misrata and Zintan regional
militias.)
3. In an effort to address these problems el-Keib is making changes in his new administration, removing
Minister of Economics Taher Sherkaz, who, as a former economic advisor to Qaddafi, was a particular target of
the militiamen. In the opinion of well informed individuals, el-Keib's closest and most influential advisors are
experts with economic backgrounds and experience dealing with Western firms and governments. The most
influential of this group are Minister of Oil Abdulrahman Ben Yezza, Minister of Finance Hassan Ziglam,
National Oil Company chief Nun Berntsien, and Ngeb Obeda from the Libyan Stock Exchange.
4. (Source Comment In the opinion of a very sensitive source, el-Keib and Sall are also very concerned
over growing criticism that these technocrats are puppets of various Western governments and firms. Belhaj
and the militiamen appear intent on limiting the influence of these Western entities, using them as a weapon to
weaken the el-Keib regime. This trend is also affecting national security, where, despite el-Keib's efforts to
maintain a balance between the Islamists, regional commanders, and the national army, a potentially
dangerous conflict has arisen over thc position of Chief of Staff of the National Army. El-Kieb, according to this
individual, believes that he must settle this matter in short order to avoid provoking security concerns among
foreign allies and businesses contacts)
5. According to a knowledgeable individual, in late December 2011e1-Kieb resisted efforts by General
Khalifa Belqasirn Hefter to establish himself as the Chief of Staff of the National Army. Hefter, who lived in the

United States for many years and is believed by Belhaj and others to have a relationship with the U.S.
Government, is using his popularity among the officer corps of the regular NTC army to support his claim to be
Chief of Staff. This produced heated protests from militia leaders and in late December 2011e1-Keib named
deputy Minister of Defense Colonel Yussef al-Mangoush, to be Chief of Staff. In the opinion of one source, this
is a problematic choice, since el-Keib is replacing the supposedly pro-American Halter with al-Mangoush who
commanded one of Qaddafi's elite Special Forces units, even after the revolution began. This individual
believes that el-ICeib's decision was driven by personal animosity toward Haftar, and the influence of Minister
of Defense Oswalt aleluwali. The situation is far from resolved, as Hefter and his supporters, particularly in
the Benghazi garrison, continue to claim that the General is the true Chief of Staff. El-Keib and aleiuwali are
working to reconcile all of the elements in this conflict as quickly as possible, before the supporters of the two
claimants begin fighting. In the meantime, el-IC.eib has stated in private that he fully expects Belhaj to attack
al-Mangoush, but the Prime Minister believes that the Colonel is the only officer strong enough to disarm the
militias and avoid a civil war.
6. At the same time, a very sensitive source added that el-Keib and Jail are attempting to reconcile the
fighting between Misrata and Zintan forces in Tripoli by naming Misrata leader Fawzi Abd Ali as Minister of
the Interior and al4uwali, who was commander of the Zintan militia, as Minister of Defense. To date,
according to this individual, this effort has met with limited success, as the fighting has continued and the
militias are refusing to disarm until their demands regarding living standards are met.
7. (Source Comment: One very sensitive source noted, that el-Keib is aware of the fact that he is
running out of time to stabilize the situation in Libya. He believes that if he does not disarm the militias and
meet their demands in the next six months there is a good chance of increased fighting among rival groups that
could lead to civil war. In any event, he realizes that the ongoing instability will cause Western governments,
firms, and banks, to hesitate before committing themselves to long term relationships with Libya. El-Keib
believes that Belhaj and his advisors have made the same judgment, and are waiting to fill any vacuum created
by this violence, by establishing a conservative Islamic Republic.)

Statement on the Attack in Benghazi
September 11, 2012
I condemn in the strongest terms the attack on our mission in Benghazi today. As we work to
secure our personnel and facilities, we have confirmed that one of our State Department officers
was killed. We are heartbroken by this terrible loss. Our thoughts and prayers are with his family
and those who have suffered in this attack.
This evening, I called Libyan President Magariaf to coordinate additional support to protect
Americans in Libya. President Magariaf expressed his condemnation and condolences and
pledged his government's full cooperation.
Some have sought to justify this vicious behavior as a response to inflammatory material posted
on the Internet. The United States deplores any intentional effort to denigrate the religious beliefs
of others. Our commitment to religious tolerance goes back to the very beginning of our nation.
But let me be clear: There is never any justification for violent acts of this kind.
In light of the events of today, the United States government is working with partner countries
around the world to protect our personnel, our missions, and American citizens worldwide.
Statement on the Death of American Personnel in Benghazi, Libya
September 12, 2012
It is with profound sadness that I share the news of the death of four American personnel in
Benghazi, Libya yesterday. Among them were United States Ambassador to Libya Chris Stevens
and Foreign Service Information Management Officer, Sean Smith. We are still making next of
kin notifications for the other two individuals. Our hearts go out to all their families and
colleagues.
A 21 year veteran of the Foreign Service, Ambassador Stevens died last night from injuries he
sustained in the attack on our office in Benghazi.
I had the privilege of swearing in Chris for his post in Libya only a few months ago. He spoke
eloquently about his passion for service, for diplomacy and for the Libyan people. This
assignment was only the latest in his more than two decades of dedication to advancing closer
ties with the people of the Middle East and North Africa which began as a Peace Corps
Volunteer in Morocco. As the conflict in Libya unfolded, Chris was one of the first Americans
on the ground in Benghazi. He risked his own life to lend the Libyan people a helping hand to
build the foundation for a new, free nation. He spent every day since helping to finish the work
that he started. Chris was committed to advancing America's values and interests, even when
that meant putting himself in danger.
Sean Smith was a husband and a father of two, who joined the Department ten years ago. Like

Chris, Sean was one of our best. Prior to arriving in Benghazi, he served in Baghdad, Pretoria,
Montreal, and most recently The Hague.
All the Americans we lost in yesterday's attacks made the ultimate sacrifice. We condemn this
vicious and violent attack that took their lives, which they had committed to helping the Libyan
people reach for a better future.
America's diplomats and development experts stand on the front lines every day for our country.
We are honored by the service of each and every one of them.
Remarks on the Deaths of American Personnel in Benghazi, Libya
September 12, 2012
Yesterday, our U.S. diplomatic post in Benghazi, Libya was attacked. Heavily armed militants
assaulted the compound and set fire to our buildings. American and Libyan security personnel
battled the attackers together. Four Americans were killed. They included Sean Smith, a Foreign
Service information management officer, and our Ambassador to Libya Chris Stevens. We are
still making next of kin notifications for the other two individuals.
This is an attack that should shock the conscience of people of all faiths around the world. We
condemn in the strongest terms this senseless act of violence, and we send our prayers to the
families, friends, and colleagues of those we've lost.
All over the world, every day, America's diplomats and development experts risk their lives in
the service of our country and our values, because they believe that the United States must be a
force for peace and progress in the world, that these aspirations are worth striving and sacrificing
for. Alongside our men and women in uniform, they represent the best traditions of a bold and
generous nation.
In the lobby of this building, the State Department, the names of those who have fallen in the line
of duty are inscribed in marble. Our hearts break over each one. And now, because of this
tragedy, we have new heroes to honor and more friends to mourn.
Chris Stevens fell in love with the Middle East as a young Peace Corps volunteer teaching
English in Morocco. He joined the Foreign Service, learned languages, won friends for America
in distant places, and made other people's hopes his own.
In the early days of the Libyan revolution, I asked Chris to be our envoy to the rebel opposition.
He arrived on a cargo ship in the port of Benghazi and began building our relationships with
Libya's revolutionaries. He risked his life to stop a tyrant, then gave his life trying to help build a
better Libya. The world needs more Chris Stevenses. I spoke with his sister, Ann, this morning,
and told her that he will be remembered as a hero by many nations.

Sean Smith was an Air Force veteran. He spent 10 years as an information management officer
in the State Department, he was posted at The Hague, and was in Libya on a brief temporary
assignment. He was a husband to his wife Heather, with whom I spoke this morning. He was a
father to two young children, Samantha and Nathan. They will grow up being proud of the
service their father gave to our country, service that took him from Pretoria to Baghdad, and
finally to Benghazi.
The mission that drew Chris and Sean and their colleagues to Libya is both noble and necessary,
and we and the people of Libya honor their memory by carrying it forward. This is not easy.
Today, many Americans are asking — indeed, I asked myself— how could this happen? How
could this happen in a country we helped liberate, in a city we helped save from destruction?
This question reflects just how complicated and, at times, how confounding the world can be.
But we must be clear-eyed, even in our grief. This was an attack by a small and savage group —
not the people or Government of Libya. Everywhere Chris and his team went in Libya, in a
country scarred by war and tyranny, they were hailed as friends and partners. And when the
attack came yesterday, Libyans stood and fought to defend our post. Some were wounded.
Libyans carried Chris' body to the hospital, and they helped rescue and lead other Americans to
safety. And last night, when I spoke with the President of Libya, he strongly condemned the
violence and pledged every effort to protect our people and pursue those responsible.
The friendship between our countries, borne out of shared struggle, will not be another casualty
of this attack. A free and stable Libya is still in America's interest and security, and we will not
turn our back on that, nor will we rest until those responsible for these attacks are found and
brought to justice. We are working closely with the Libyan authorities to move swiftly and
surely. We are also working with partners around the world to safeguard other American
embassies, consulates, and citizens.
There will be more time later to reflect, but today, we have work to do. There is no higher
priority than protecting our men and women wherever they serve. We are working to determine
the precise motivations and methods of those who carried out this assault. Some have sought to
justify this vicious behavior, along with the protest that took place at our Embassy in Cairo
yesterday, as a response to inflammatory material posted on the intemet. America's commitment
to religious tolerance goes back to the very beginning of our nation. But let me be clear — there is
no justification for this, none. Violence like this is no way to honor religion or faith. And as long
as there are those who would take innocent life in the name of God, the world will never know a
true and lasting peace.
It is especially difficult that this happened on September I I th. It's an anniversary that means a
great deal to all Americans. Every year on that day, we are reminded that our work is not yet
finished, that the job of putting an end to violent extremism and building a safe and stable world
continues. But September 11th means even more than that. It is a day on which we remember

Statement on the Deaths of Tyrone S. Woods and Glen A. Doherty in Benghazi, Libya
September 13, 2012
The attack on our diplomatic post in Benghazi, Libya on Tuesday claimed the lives of four
Americans. Yesterday, I spoke about two: Ambassador Chris Stevens and Information
Management Officer Sean Smith. Today, we also recognize the two security personnel who died
helping protect their colleagues. Tyrone S. Woods and Glen A. Doherty were both decorated
military veterans who served our country with honor and distinction. Our thoughts, prayers, and
deepest gratitude are with their families and friends. Our embassies could not carry on our
critical work around the world without the service and sacrifice of brave people like Tyrone and
Glen.
Tyrone's friends and colleagues called him "Rone," and they relied on his courage and skill,
honed over two decades as a Navy SEAL. In uniform, he served multiple tours in Iraq and
Afghanistan. Since 2010, he protected American diplomatic personnel in dangerous posts from
Central America to the Middle East. He had the hands of a healer as well as the arm of a warrior,
earning distinction as a registered nurse and certified paramedic. All our hearts go out to
Tyrone's wife Dorothy and his three sons, Tyrone Jr., Hunter, and Kai, who was born just a few
months ago.
We also grieve for Glen Doherty, called Bub, and his family: his father Bernard, his mother
Barbara, his brother Gregory, and his sister Kathleen. Glen was also a former Navy SEAL and an
experienced paramedic. And he put his life on the line many times, protecting Americans in Iraq,
Afghanistan, and other hotspots. In the end, he died the way he lived — with selfless honor and
unstinting valor.
We condemn the attack that took the lives of these heroes in the strongest terms, and we are
taking additional steps to safeguard American embassies, consulates, and citizens around the
world. This violence should shock the conscience of people of all faiths and traditions. We
appreciate the statements of support that have poured in from across the region and beyond.

People of conscience and goodwill everywhere must stand together in these difficult days against
violence, hate, and division.
I am enormously proud of the men and women who risk their lives every day in the service of
our country and our values. They help make the United States the greatest force for peace,

Remarks at the Opening Plenary of the U.S.-Morocco Strategic Dialogue
September 13, 2012
SECRETARY CLINTON: Good morning. Well, let me welcome our friends and colleagues
from Morocco here to the Benjamin Franklin Room on the eighth floor of the State Department
for this very important first session of the U.S.-Morocco Strategic Dialogue. Before I begin to
address the significance of this Strategic Dialogue and the next step in our long relations with
Morocco, I want to say a few words about the events unfolding in the world today.
We are closely watching what is happening in Yemen and elsewhere, and we certainly hope and
expect that there will be steps taken to avoid violence and prevent the escalation of protests into
violence.
I also want to take a moment to address the video circulating on the Internet that has led to these
protests in a number of countries. Let me state very clearly — and I hope it is obvious — that the
United States Government had absolutely nothing to do with this video. We absolutely reject its
content and message. America's commitment to religious tolerance goes back to the very
beginning of our nation. And as you know, we are home to people of all religions, many of
whom came to this country seeking the right to exercise their own religion, including, of course,
millions of Muslims. And we have the greatest respect for people of faith.
To us, to me personally, this video is disgusting and reprehensible. It appears to have a deeply
cynical purpose: to denigrate a great religion and to provoke rage. But as I said yesterday, there
is no justification, none at all, for responding to this video with violence, We condemn the
violence that has resulted in the strongest terms, and we greatly appreciate that many Muslims in
the United States and around the world have spoken out on this issue.
Violence, we believe, has no place in religion and is no way to honor religion. Islam, like other
religions, respects the fundamental dignity of human beings, and it is a violation of that
fundamental dignity to wage attacks on innocents. As long as there are those who are willing to
shed blood and take innocent life in the name of religion, the name of God, the world will never
know a true and lasting peace. It is especially wrong for violence to be directed against
diplomatic missions. These are places whose very purpose is peaceful: to promote better
understuiding across countries and cultures. All governments have a responsibility to protect

those spaces and people, because to attack an embassy is to attack the idea that we can work
together to build understanding and a better future.
Now, I know it is hard for some people to understand why the United States cannot or does not
just prevent these kinds of reprehensible videos from ever seeing the light of day. Now, I would
note that in today's world with today's technologies, that is impossible. But even if it were
possible, our country does have a long tradition of free expression which is enshrined in our
Constitution and our law, and we do not stop individual citizens from expressing their views no
matter how distasteful they may be.
There are, of course, different views around the world about the outer limits of free speech and
free expression, but there should be no debate about the simple proposition that violence in
response to speech is not acceptable. We all — whether we are leaders in government, leaders in
civil society or religious leaders — must draw the line at violence. And any responsible leader
should be standing up now and drawing that line.
I wanted to begin with this statement, because, as our Moroccan friends and all of you know, this
has been a difficult week at the State Department. I very much appreciate, Minister, the
condolences your government expressed to our Embassy in Rabat And even though that tragedy
happened far away in Benghazi, we found a reminder of the deep bounds that connect Morocco
to the United States. It was in the High Atlas Mountains of Morocco that one of the Americans
we lost this week, Ambassador Chris Stevens, fell in love with the region when he served as a
Peace Corps volunteer there. That experience set him on a decades-long career of service. So in
the memory of fallen friends and colleagues, let us remind ourselves of the many ways in which
riot just our governments but the people of our two nations have worked together to build a better
future.
In many ways, the United States looks to Morocco to be a leader and a model. His Majesty King
Mohammed deserves great credit for the work you've undertaken. In fact, after my visit to Rabat
earlier this year. I told my team: "We need to start a Strategic Dialogue with Morocco." No
country has been a friend of the United States longer than Morocco. You were the first nation to
recognize us back in 1777. But we're not satisfied with simply having a friendship that is
longstanding We want one that is dynamic, growing, looking toward the future. So let me
highlight a few of the areas we should focus on today.
On political reform, we have all seen remarkable changes taking place across North Africa and
the Middle East. I commend Morocco and your government for your efforts to stay ahead of
these changes by holding free and fair elections, empowering the elected parliament, taking other
steps to ensure that the government reflects the will of the people. Today, our political working
group will discuss how the United States can continue to support your efforts to translate
commitments into actions. Because as we all know, democracy, real reform, require that people
themselves feel the changes in their evetyday lives: the courts reformed, the government more

open and transparent, universal human rights of all Moroccans — men and women alike —
respected.
I'm especially pleased by Morocco's commitments to take on the deeply troubling problem of
child marriage. We know that child brides are less likely to get an education, more likely to face
life-threatening problems, particularly around child birth and delivery, which not only
shortchanges them but can even rob them and their communities of their lives and talents. So we
want to encourage the government and civil society to continue their important work together on
this issue.
With regard to the Western Sahara, the United States continues to support efforts to find a
peaceful, sustainable, mutually agreed-upon solution. U.S. policy toward the Western Sahara has
remained consistent for many years. We have made clear that Morocco's autonomy plan is
serious, realistic, and credible, and that it represents a potential approach that could satisfy the
aspirations of the people in the Western Sahara to run their own affairs in peace and dignity. We
continue to support the negotiations carried out by the United Nations and hope parties can work
toward resolution.
With respect to the economy, our second working group will focus on what more can be done to
deliver tangible economic benefits. Morocco's economy is relatively healthy, but you face the
same problem that is now endemic across the world — unemployment is still too high, especially
among young people.
That's why the United States is providing $1.5 million to support an effort to attract foreign
investors, foster local economic development, and combat corruption across the region. And I'm
pleased to announce that later this year we will hold a Morocco business development
conference here in Washington to connect businesses from both countries.
Today, we should discuss ways to build on all of these efforts by increasing bilateral trade, a
particular goal of mine since so much trade from Morocco goes to Europe. I'd like to increase
the amount of trade coming to the United States, and also to improve economic integration
across North Africa, which could greatly benefit Morocco because of Morocco's stability and
Morocco's very strong economic foundation. The greater integration there is, the greater the
benefits for Moroccans.
Third, the attack in Benghazi this week reminds us that security remains a vital issue. Through
our work together on the Global Counterterrorism Task Force, the United States and Morocco
already share crucial information and best practices, and I thank Morocco for hosting a Global
Counterterrorism Task Force workshop on threats in the South Atlantic next month.

We are also collaborating through USAID, the Peace Corps, and other agencies to help provide
Moroccan youth with alternatives to criminal and extremist organizations. And so we are
partnering to help strengthen Morocco's criminal justice system and law enforcement.
There will be a lot to discuss in the meeting today. And let me add, the United States greatly
appreciates the constructive role Morocco is playing on the UN Security Council, especially your
support for the effort to end the violence and bloodshed in Syria and help to usher in a new
democratic future for that country. I commend Morocco for offering to host the next ministerial
meeting of the Friends of the Syrian People, and we look forward to continuing to work closely
together as close partners even after your term on the Security Council has ended.
Finally, our education and cultural ties are reason for much celebration. This year marks the 30th
anniversary of our official program to facilitate academic exchanges and other bonds between us.
There are more than 5,000 Moroccan alumni of these programs. Two are with us today — Dr.
Benjelloun and Dr. Ouaouicha — and we thank them. But among all our work on this front, from
preserving Morocco's historic sites to empowering youth, there's one area I particularly hope we
can focus on today and receive your advice and counsel — namely, interfaith dialogue.
In these tense and turbulent times, it's more important than ever for people of different faiths to
exchange ideas, to build understanding, to promote religious tolerance. It's one of the great
challenges of the 21st century, and it's one that we must address together.
So we have a lot of work to do, Minister, but our friendship runs long and deep, and as the treaty
our nations signed in 1786 says, and I quote, "Trusting in God, it will remain permanent." I'm
confident that we will continue to solve problems and produce results that make our nations
stronger, more peaceful, more secure, more prosperous, and also contribute to doing the same for
the world.
So again, let me welcome you, Minister. It's been a great pleasure for me to get to know you, to
work with you, to be your colleague bilaterally, regionally, and globally, and also welcome your
distinguished delegation.
Thank you. (Applause.)
Remarks at Reception Ntlarking Eid ul-Fitr
September 13, 2012
SECRETARY CLINTON: Good evening, and although I am many weeks overdue in saying it:
Eid Mubarak. No matter how belated we are honoring Eid and the end of Ramadan, this is a
cherished tradition here at the State Department. And I would like to thank all of you for being
here, including the many members of the Diplomatic Corps.

Tonight, our gathering is more somber than any of us would like. This comes during sad and
difficult days for the State Department family. We lost four Americans. They were good and
brave men. They were committed to the cause of building a brighter future for the people of
Libya. And we condemn the violence in the strongest terms, the violence against our posts in
Benghazi, in Egypt, and now in Yemen.
The Libyan ambassador is with us tonight, and I want to take a moment to thank him for the
support that his government and the Libyan people have shown to the United States in this
tragedy, particularly the outpouring of feelings of grief and loss because of the killing of our
ambassador.
Ambassador Aujali, would you mind saying a few words?
AMBASSADOR AMU: [redacted]
SECRETARY CLINTON: Thank you very much, Ambassador. I know that that was a very
personal loss for you, as it was for me. I'm the one who sent Chris to Benghazi during the
revolution to show support and be able to advise our government about what we could do to
bring freedom and democracy and opportunity to the people of Libya.
Religious freedom and religious tolerance are essential to the stability of any nation, any people.
Hatred and violence in the name of religion only poison the well. All people of faith and good
will know that the actions of a small and savage group in Benghazi do not honor religion or God
in any way. Nor do they speak for the more than one billion Muslims around the world, many of
whom have shown an outpouring of support during this time
Unfortunately, however, over the last 24 hours, we have also seen violence spread elsewhere.
Some seek to justify this behavior as a response to inflammatory, despicable material posted on
the intemet. As I said earlier today, the United States rejects both the content and the message of
that video. The United States deplores any intentional effort to denigrate the religious beliefs of
others. At our meeting earlier today, my colleague, the foreign minister of Morocco, said that all
prophets should be respected because they are all symbols of our humanity, for all humanity.
But both of us were crystal clear in this paramount message: There is never any justification for
violent acts of this kind. And we look to leaders around the world to stand up and speak out
against violence, and to take steps to protect diplomatic missions from attack.
Think about it. When Christians are subject to insults to their faith, and that certainly happens,
we expect them not to resort to violence. When Hindus or Buddhists are subjected to insults to
their faiths, and that also certainly happens, we expect them not to resort to violence. The same
goes for all faiths, including Islam.

When all of us who are people of faith - and I am one — feel the pain of insults, of
misunderstanding, of denigration to what we cherish, we must expect ourselves and others not to
resort to violence, That is a universal standard and expectation, and it is everyone's obligation to
meet that, so that we make no differences, we expect no less of ourselves than we expect of
others, You cannot respond to offensive speech with violence without begetting more violence.
And I so strongly believe that the great religions of the world are stronger than any insults. They
have withstood offense for centuries. Refraining from violence, then, is not a sign of weakness in
one's faith; it is absolutely the opposite, a sign that one's faith is unshakable.
So tonight, we must come together and recommit ourselves to working toward a future marked
by understanding and acceptance rather than distrust, hatred, and fear. We can pledge that
whenever one person speaks out in ignorance and bigotry, ten voices will answer. They will
answer resoundingly against the offense and the insult, answering ignorance with enlightenment,
answering hatred with understanding, answering darkness with light; that if one person commits
a violent act in the name of religion, millions will stand up and condemn it out of strength.
In times like these, it can be easy to despair that some differences are irreconcilable, some
mountains too steep to climb; we will therefore never reach the level of understanding and
peacefulness that we seek, and which I believe the great religions of the world call us to pursue.
But that's not what I believe, and I don't think it's what you believe either here tonight. Part of
what makes our country so special is we keep trying. We keep working. We keep investing in
our future. We keep supporting the next generation, believing that young people can keep us
moving forward in a positive direction.
So tonight I think it's important that we talk not just about that better tomorrow that we all seek,
but also about some of the things — the real, practical, tangible things — that young people are
doing to help shape that better future.
Two years ago in this room, at our Eid reception, we launched a program called Generation
Change to lead a grassroots agenda of positive engagement with Muslim communities. And I
asked the young Muslim leaders in the audience that night to be our unofficial ambassadors, to
help build personal connections, seek out partners in other countries. And I can report to you
tonight they did not disappoint. In a few minutes, you're going to meet some of these young
leaders, each with a powerful story to tell.
The Generation Change network that started in this room now circles the globe. We are building
an international alliance of young people who want to drive change in their own communities.
They act as mentors, spark respectful debates, simply offer words of encouragement when
needed. But most importantly, they inspire others to keep expanding the circle of mutual
understanding and respect, one person at a time.

Even as we work to spread tolerance more broadly, we also are working to deepen our
appreciation for the experiences of others. Our 2012 Hours Against Hate initiative encourages
young people to put themselves in another person's shoes through service projects. So far, young
people from all over the world have pledged thousands of volunteer hours to help people from a
different background, to see them as a fellow human being, not a stereotype, not a caricature, but
another real live person — people who don't look like you, live like you, pray like you, but with
whom we will share this planet. And therefore, we have work to do.
People of faith and conscience are called to be the leaders of tolerance. In my tradition, like all
traditions, we are expected to love one another. And together, we have to translate that into better
understanding and cooperation. I'm particularly pleased that the young people you will hear from
tonight are really setting an example, not only for young people elsewhere in the world but,
frankly, for us who are older as well.
Let me now call to the stage someone who has been a tremendous assistance to me in these
efforts. Farah Pandith is the Department's first Special Representative to Muslim Communities.
And from the beginning, she has made reaching out to young people and civil society her top
priority. Farah will introduce you to three young leaders who I am very proud of
Remarks at the Transfer of Remains Ceremony to Honor Those Lost in Attacks in Benghazi, Libya
September 14, 2012
SECRETARY CLINTON: Thank you very much, Chaplain. Mr. President, Mr. Vice President,
Secretary Panetta, Ambassador Rice, Secretary Powell and Mrs. Powell, family members of the
four patriots and heroes we bring home, members of the State Department family, ladies and
gentlemen, today we bring home four Americans who gave their lives for our country and our
values. To the families of our fallen colleagues, I offer our most heartfelt condolences and
deepest gratitude.
Sean Smith joined the State Department after six years in the Air Force. He was respected as an
expert on technology by colleagues in Pretoria, Baghdad, Montreal, and The Hague. He enrolled
in correspondence courses at Penn State and had high hopes for the future. Sean leaves behind a
loving wife Heather, two young children, Samantha and Nathan, and scores of grieving family,
friends, and colleagues. And that's just in this world. Because online in the virtual worlds that
Sean helped create, he is also being mourned by countless competitors, collaborators, and garners
who shared his passion.
Tyrone Woods, known to most as Rone, spent two decades as a Navy SEAL, serving multiple
tours in Iraq and Afghanistan. Since 2010, he protected American diplomatic personnel in
dangerous posts from Central America to the Middle East. He had the hands of a healer as well
as the arms of a warrior, earning distinction as a registered nurse and certified paramedic. Our
hearts go out to Tyrone's wife Dorothy, and his three sons Tyrone, Jr., Hunter, and Kai, born just
a few months ago, along with his grieving faii)ily, friends, and colleagues.

Glen Doherty, who went by Bub, was also a former SEAL and an experienced paramedic. He too
died as he lived, serving his country and protecting his colleagues. Glen deployed to some of the
most dangerous places on Earth, including Iraq and Afghanistan, always putting his life on the
line to safeguard other Americans. Our thoughts and prayers are with Glen's father Bernard, his
mother Barbara, his brother Gregory, his sister Kathleen, and their grieving families, friends, and
colleagues.
I was honored to know Ambassador Chris Stevens. I want to thank his parents and siblings, who
are here today, for sharing Chris with us and with our country. What a wonderful gift you gave
us. Over his distinguished career in the Foreign Service, Chris won friends for the United States
in far-flung places. He made those people's hopes his own. During the revolution in Libya, he
risked his life to help protect the Libyan people from a tyrant, and he gave his life helping them
build a better country.
People loved to work with Chris. And as he rose through the ranks, they loved to work for Chris.
He was known not only for his courage but for his smile — goofy but contagious — for his sense
of fun and that California cool.
In the days since the attack, so many Libyans — including the Ambassador from Libya to the
United States, who is with us today — have expressed their sorrow and solidarity. One young
woman, her head covered and her eyes haunted with sadness, held up a handwritten sign that said
"Thugs and killers don't represent Benghazi nor Islam," The President of the Palestinian
Authority, who worked closely with Chris when he served in Jerusalem, sent me a letter
remembering his energy and integrity, and deploring — and I quote — "an act of ugly terror."
Many others from across the Middle East and North Africa have offered similar sentiments.
This has been a difficult week for the State Department and for our country. We've seen the
heavy assault on our post in Benghazi that took the lives of those brave men. We've seen rage
and violence directed at American embassies over an awful interne video that we had nothing to
do with. It is hard for the American people to make sense of that because it is senseless, and it is
totally unacceptable.
The people of Egypt, Libya, Yemen, and Tunisia did not trade the tyranny of a dictator for the
tyranny of a mob. Reasonable people and responsible leaders in these countries need to do
everything they can to restore security and hold accountable those behind these violent acts. And
we will, under the President's leadership, keep taking steps to protect our personnel around the
world.
There will be more difficult days ahead, but it is important that we don't lose sight of the
fundamental fact that America must keep leading the world. We owe it to those four men to
continue the long, hard work of diplomacy. I am enormously proud of the men and women of the
State Department. I'm proud of all those across our government, civilian and military alike, who

represent America abroad. They help make the United States the greatest force for peace,
progress, and human dignity the world has ever known. If the last few days teach us anything, let
it be this: That this work and the men and women who risk their lives to do it are at the heart of
what makes America great and good.
So we will wipe away our tears, stiffen our spines, and face the future undaunted. And we will
do it together, protecting and helping one another, just like Sean, Tyrone, Glen, and Chris always
did. May God bless them and grant their families peace and solace, and may God continue to
bless the United States of America.
And now, let me have the great honor of introducing someone who came to the State Department
earlier this week to grieve with us. He well understands and values the work that these men were
doing for our country. The President of the United States.
Remarks With Mexican Secretary of Foreign Relations Patricia Espinosa After Their
Meeting
September 18, 2012
SECRETARY CLINTON: Good afternoon, everyone. And it is such a pleasure for me to
welcome my friend and colleague, Secretary Espinosa, along with a very distinguished
delegation of officials from the Mexican Government for this continuation of consultation at the
highest levels of each of our governments.
Before I turn to the matters discussed today, let me give a brief update on the ongoing U.S.
response to the protests in the Middle East and elsewhere. I'm sure as you know already, we are
taking aggressive steps to protect our staffs in embassies and consulates worldwide. That
includes reviewing our security posture at every post and augmenting it where necessary. And
we are working closely with the Libyan Government in our efforts to bring to justice those who
murdered our four American colleagues in Benghazi.
The FBI is now in Tripoli to join the investigation with Libyan officials, and there is nothing
more important to us than ensuring the safety of our American representatives worldwide. At the
same time, as I have said to State Department employees, the incidents of the past week highlight
how important our work is. The United States must and will remain strongly engaged in the
world. Our men and women risk their lives in service to our country and our values, because they
know that the United States must be a force for peace and progress. That is worth striving and
sacrificing for, and nothing that happened last week changes this fundamental fact.
Now, turning to our friends and partners in Mexico, we are always pleased to have a chance to
discuss matters of mutual interest and concern between us. Mexico is one of our closest friends
as well as partner on dozens of critical issues. So we talk about every kind of issue you can
imagine, from education and healthcare to poverty alleviation to the environment. But today, we
focused on a top priority for us both a security.

We just co-chaired the fourth meeting of the U.S.-Mexico Merida High-Level Consultative
Group. This is the last one we will hold during the Calderon Administration. And I want to offer
my personal appreciation to President Calderon and to Foreign Secretary Espinosa for their
leadership and commitment to this partnership and to all on both sides of the border in our
governments who have been deeply engaged and committed to it. The Merida Initiative
represents an unprecedented level of security cooperation between Mexico and the United States.
As our countries continue to deal with the serious challenge of transnational criminal
organizations, including drug traffickers, illegal arms traffickers, money launderers, and violent
gangs that threaten people on both sides of the border, we well know there is no quick and easy
way to stop these criminals and bring them to justice. But nevertheless, during the past now
nearly four years, our countries have collaborated to an extraordinary and unprecedented degree.
We have brought together policy makers and experts from across our governments and societies
who have worked hand in hand to keep our people safe. And I think the habits of cooperation we
have built are among our most important achievements, and we will rely on them for a long time
to come.
Today, our delegations reviewed the gains we've made on key priorities, including improving
law enforcement coordination, reducing the demand for drugs, modernizing our border
infrastructure, strengthening the rule of law, and building more resilient and empowered
communities. We also discussed the lessons we've learned and the work that lies ahead in these
and other areas, which our joint statement will reflect. I want to underscore how important our
security relationship with Mexico is to the United States.
The Government of Mexico and the Mexican people have faced the threat posed by these
criminals with courage and resolve, and we remain committed to doing everything we can to
support Mexico as it continues to work to bring those criminals to justice. This is a transnational
problem, and it calls for a transnational solution, and the United States believes this is a matter of
shared responsibility. That was the first message I brought as Secretary of State when I came to
Mexico, and it continues to be the hallmark of our efforts together. Making sure our people are
safe and our neighbors are safe is of the utmost importance to us.
Now, our two countries share many other priorities, and one of them, empowering women and
girls, was also addressed today. We took the opportunity, the Foreign Secretary and I, to sign a
Memorandum of Understanding between our countries to work together to advance gender
equality, empower girls and women, promote their human rights, and enhance their security.
So again, Secretary Espinosa, let me thank you for years of work and effort, for our productive
conversations in many places around the world and again today, and for being such a valuable
colleague and partner. The United States deeply, deeply values our relationship with Mexico and
the ties of family and friendship that connect so many millions of our people.

And we look forward to the future. We believe strongly that presidential administrations may
change, elections will come and go, but we have established a firm foundation for cooperation
that has already benefited both our countries and which will continue to benefit both of our
countries for many years ahead. So thank you very much.
MS. NULAND: We'll take (inaudible). Margaret Brennan, CBS News.
QUESTION: Madam Secretary, thanks for your time. Are you any closer to finding who killed
Ambassador Chris Stevens?, Libya's President says this attack was planned for months. Are you
confident he's wrong and that security measures were appropriate? And will you leave justice to
the Libyans?
SECRETARY CLINTON: As I said at the outset, we are taking aggressive steps to protect our
people and our consulates and embassies around the world. We are reviewing our security
posture at every post and working with host governments to be sure they know what our security-
needs are wherever necessary. We are also working closely with the Libyan Government to bring
the perpetrators to justice so that we can be assured that we have found who murdered our four,
colleagues and under what circumstances. As I said, the FBI has joined the investigation inside
Libya, and we will not rest until the people who orchestrated this attack are found and punished.
It is also important to look at this strategically and understand what is going on across the region.
In a number of places where protests have tuned violent, we are seeing the hand of extremists
who are trying to exploit people's inflamed passions for their own agendas. But overwhelmingly,
we have found that the people of Egypt, of Libya, of Yemen and Tunisia are not prepared to
trade the tyranny of a dictator for the tyranny of a mob. They want to turn their attention to the
future to provide better opportunities for themselves and their children, and they want a strong
partnership with the United States and the American people based on mutual interests and mutual
respect.
This is part of a larger debate that is going on inside these societies. In Libya, for example, in
their first free elections, moderates were successful at the polls. But look, there are extremists in
all of these societies and on the outside who are working to take advantage of broad outrage in
order to incite violence and specifically incite violence against Americans and American
facilities.
And as I have said to many of the leaders I have spoken to over the past week, these extremist
efforts are a threat to the people of the societies and the governments of those societies as well as
to the region and the United States. And I think it's important at this moment for leaders to put
themselves on the right side of this debate - to speak out clearly and unequivocally against
violence, whoever incites it or conducts it
And in a struggle like this, there can be no doubt where the United States must stand. We support
those who are fighting for the same values and rights that we believe in - in democracy, in

freedom, in universal rights for men and women, for justice and accountability. And I want to
underscore that the United States will continue to work with partners and allies in the region and
around the world to help bring security to these nations so that the promise of the revolutions that
they experienced can be realized.
And finally, on your specific point about Benghazi, we obviously never talk publicly about
security at any of our missions for obvious reasons. But that said, let me assure you that our
security in Benghazi included a unit of host government security forces, as well as a local guard
force of the kind that we rely on in many places around the world. In addition to the security
outside the compound, we relied on a wall and a robust security presence inside the compound.
And with all of our missions overseas, in advance of September lid', as is done every year, we
did an evaluation on threat streams. And the Office of the Director of National Intelligence has
said we had no actionable intelligence that an attack on our post in Benghazi was planned or
imminent.
But let me state the obvious again. Our diplomats engage in dangerous work, and it's the nature
of diplomacy in fragile societies and conflict zones to be aware of the necessity for security but
to also continue the important diplomatic work that has to go on. There is risk inherent in what
we do and what these brave men and women representing the United States are up against every
single day, and we do our very best to limit that risk by ensuring that our security protocols
reflect the environments in which diplomats work and the threats that they are presented with.
Thank you.
Remarks With Indonesian Foreign Minister Raden Mohammad Marty Muliana
Natalegawa After Their Meeting
September 20, 2012
SECRETARY CLINTON: Good afternoon, everyone. And it's such a pleasure, as always, to
welcome the Indonesian Foreign Minister, and I believe the largest delegation that has ever come
from Indonesia, for the purpose of our third meeting of the U.S.-Indonesia Joint Commission.
This commission is the result of a vision by our two presidents for a comprehensive partnership,
and the agreement to that effect was signed in 2010. Thanks to this partnership, the United States
and Indonesia are working more closely than ever on a range of issues from global security to
clean energy and climate to regional trade and commerce.
And today, Marty and I had the chance to take stock of where our teams have come in the time
of the last year, because we liad our meeting in Bali a year ago. And I must say, I was very
impressed. We covered a great deal today.

But before I start, I'd like to say a few words about the protests in several countries around the
world. We have condemned in the strongest possible terms the violence that has erupted from
these protests. And as I have said, the video that sparked these protests is disgusting and
reprehensible, and the United States Government, of course, had absolutely nothing to do with it.
But there is no justification for violence, and I want to thank the Foreign Minister and his
government for speaking out against violence. We have to look to reasonable people and
responsible leaders everywhere to stand up to extremists who would seek to take advantage of
this moment to commit violent acts against embassies and their fellow countrymen.
Today's meetings have highlighted the strong foundation that we have built together. And one of
our most important concerns is promoting peace and stability in the Asia Pacific. Today, I'm
announcing that the Obama Administration has informed Congress of the potential sale of eight
AH-64D Apache Longbow helicopters to the Indonesian Government. This agreement will
strengthen our comprehensive partnership and help enhance security across the region.
On growth and prosperity, we are increasing our trade relationship that topped $26 billion last
year. Investments in transportation, energy, and infrastructure are creating jobs and supporting
economic growth in both countries. For example, the deal between Lion Air and Boeing alone
represents $21 billion in trade over the next decade. Indonesia's Government has announced half
a trillion dollars in infrastructure improvements, and we recently signed a memorandum of
understanding to make it easier for American companies to bid on these projects.
And yesterday, we signed an agreement for implementing our Millennium Challenge
Corporation Compact with Indonesia. Over the next five years, the United States will invest $600
million in clean energy development, child health and nutrition programs, and efforts to help
make Indonesia's Government more transparent and open.
The United States is also looking forward to Indonesia hosting APEC in 2013, and we are
confident that Indonesia will come to this role with a commitment to promote greater economic
integration across the Asia Pacific.
Both the Foreign Minister and I believe that strong education is essential to compete in a modem
global economy. That's why the United States has expanded the Fulbright Program and
supported partnerships between dozens of American and Indonesian universities. Academic
exchanges between our countries are up and applications from Indonesian students to visit the
United States have increased by one third. USAID has recently expanded its basic education
program to provide $83 million for teacher training and literacy programs for young children.
And we're providing $20 in scholarship funding for Indonesian graduate students.

I also thanked the Minister for Indonesia's leadership in ASEAN. The Foreign Minister's
personal leadership has helped lay the groundwork for diplomacy between ASEAN and China as
it relates to the South China Sea. And we continue to support ASEAN's six-point principles,
which we believe will help reduce tensions and pave the way for a comprehensive code of
conduct for addressing disputes without threats, coercion, or use of force.
Finally. Indonesia and the United States have stood together on a range of global challenges,
from democratic reform in Burma to combating climate change, to working to end the violence
in Syria. We are also coordinating efforts to further develop south-south and triangular
cooperation, such as enhancing disaster preparedness in Burma and convening a conference on
women's empowerment.
We believe that as the second and third-largest democracies in the world, the United States and
Indonesia have a special responsibility to promote democracy and human rights. And for the last
four years, Indonesia has hosted the Bali Democracy Forum to promote peaceful, democratic
transitions through example and open dialogue. Last year, more than 80 countries attended. And
once again, the United States will be sending a high-level delegation.
So, Minister, thank you for everything. Thank you for the great partnership we've had between
us and between our countries.
MS. NULAND: We'll take two questions today, we'll start with Ros Jordan of Al Jazeera
English.
QUESTION: Thank you, Madam Secretary, Mr. Foreign Minister. Madam Secretary, my
question is about the ongoing investigation into last week's attack at the consulate in Benghazi.
You are meeting this afternoon with members of Congress to discuss the progress and the
concerns that they understandably have. First, there is the federal mandate to establish an
accountability review board. Have you done so? Who would you like to see chair it? Are there
certain questions that you desperately want to have answered in order to safeguard the safety of
Foreign Service Officers around the world?
And related to this, given the political instability and the successes of the past year and a half, are
you satisfied that in light of those political changes, enough was done to protect those working in
the Middle East and North Africa? And then finally — and this is perhaps going into the area of
rumor and speculation — but there is at least one report suggesting that Ambassador Stevens felt
that he was on a, quote, "al-Qaida hit list" Is this a scurrilous rumor? Is this gallows humor
when one is working in a period of difficulty and great challenge, or is there something more to
what he allegedly — and I stress that word — said?

SECRETARY CLINTON: Well, first, let me say I'm looking forward to the opportunity to go
up to the Congress today. I will be briefing in two separate sessions, the House and the Senate, in
a classified setting, along with my interagency colleagues, as we continue to work together, and
with governments around the world, to ensure that our people and our facilities are safe. I will be
joined today by the Director of National Intelligence, General Clapper, by the Deputy Secretary
of Defense, Ash Carter, by the Vice Chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff, Sandy Winnefeld,
along with experts from the FBI, the State Department, and elsewhere in the government.
Now, I anticipate that this briefing will cover our security posture before and during the events,
and the steps we have taken since to do everything we can with host governments to protect our
people and our embassies and consulates. The Director of National Intelligence will speak to the
intelligence issues surrounding these events in Libya. Deputy Secretary Carter will brief on the
superb support we have had from the U.S. military in the wake of these events, and we are at the
very early stages of an FBI investigation. The team from the FBI reached Libya earlier this week.
And I will advise Congress also that I am launching an accountability review board that will be
chaired by Ambassador Thomas Pickering.
I will also talk about the importance of the broader relationships with these countries in light of
the events of the past days. There are obviously very real challenges in these new democracies,
these fragile societies, but as I said last week, the vast majority of the people in these countries
did not throw off the tyranny of a dictator to trade it for the tyranny of a mob. And we are
concerned first and foremost with our own people and facilities, but we are concerned about the
internal security in these countries because ultimately, that puts at risk the men, women, and
children of these societies on a daily ongoing basis if actions are not taken to try to restore
security and civil order.
And let me just conclude by saying that there can be no doubt where the United States stands.
We continue to support those who are fighting for universal values — values that we see at work
in Indonesia — the third largest democracy in the world. We believe that these values of universal
rights, of justice and accountability, of democracy, are there for every person regardless of where
that person might live. So I will look forward to having a chance to talk with members of
Congress.
As to your final question, I have absolutely no information or reason to believe that there's any
basis for that.
QUESTION: Thank you.
MS. NULAND: Last question. Victoria Sidjabat from Tempo Magazine, please.
QUESTION: Yes. Madam, thank you. My question is: Starting today, U.S. Embassy and
Consulate are closed in Indonesia as the Muslim movie become wild fireball, which could be

designed as a weapon to attack U.S. by raising sentiment anti-U.S. from the countries which has
Muslim majority population like Indonesia.
Madam Clinton, how do you see this threat as on the long run? If it's continuing happen, it's —
obviously could give impact to the implementation of (inaudible) program in Indonesia. What is
the reason U.S. Government closed the Embassy and Consulate in Indonesia? What is your
expectation from Indonesia Government, for my Minister Marty Natalegawa? How Indonesia
Government respond to the closing of this Embassy and Consulate, it's starting today? Is U.S. —
Indonesia Government has capability to protect U.S. Embassy and Consulate. So the (inaudible)
program implemented — could be implemented successfully in Indonesia. Thank you.
SECRETARY CLINTON: Well, let me begin by saying how grateful we are for the excellent
cooperation we have received from the Government of Indonesia, and in particular, from the law
enforcement and security institutions in Indonesia. We are very grateful for not only the
cooperation and protection that has been provided to our facilities, but also to the strong
statements condemning violence from the President, the Foreign Mihister, and others.
In consultation with the Government of Indonesia, we have temporarily, for tomorrow, closed
our facilities. We want to be sure that law enforcement in Indonesia has the ability to do what it
needs to do to make sure that there is no disruption of civil order and security. So we are
cooperating completely, and we're very grateful for the strong leadership provided by Indonesia.
FOREIGN MINISTER NATALEGAWA: Hello, (inaudible), if I may just also respond.
Precisely as the Secretary had said, the decision by the United States Government to close
temporarily its embassies and consulates tomorrow in Indonesia is a decision that's been made
based on communication and conversation between the authorities in Indonesia and the United
States as well. So in other words, it is an informed decision, a decision that is not intended to
show any unfriendly intent on the part of anyone, but it is what it is, and it's quite some — it's the
kind of step that governments actually carry out when situations requires it, even in our case.
Some of our embassies abroad, when the situation requires us to have a temporary closing of the
embassy, we do that as well. So it is something that is quite regular and something that is
actually coordinated as well.
But if I may just broaden the subject matter, I think as our President had said in the past,
Indonesian Government the Indonesian people, even, obviously cannot and would not condone
the — any acts of violence against diplomatic premises, against diplomatic personnel, because
that is, truly — would be a challenge to the efficient and a proper conduct of relations among
states. So that's our point of departure.
At the same time, of course, beyond the immediate issue of protection of the embassies, we have
still ahead of us the challenge of how to prevent the kind of situations where we are now at in

terms of the kind of incendiary and the kind of statements or, in this instance, films that cause —
that is now we have all deplored and condemned for these kind of activities not to be repeated.
So we have a lot of homework to work towards in the future as well.

FOREIGN MINISTER NATALEGAWA: Thank you.
Remarks With Pakistani Foreign Minister Hina Rabbani Khar Before Their Meeting
September 21, 2012
Good afternoon, and let me begin by welcoming Foreign Minister Khar on her first visit to
Washington as foreign minister. We've had the opportunity to meet in Islamabad and other
settings, but I am very pleased that we would have this chance to exchange views on our bilateral
relationship as well as regional and global issues.
I want to begin by addressing the events of the day and the past week. Today, we've once again
seen protests in several cities in Pakistan. Unfortunately, some of those protests have turned
violent and, sadly, resulted in loss of life. I want to thank the Government of Pakistan for their
efforts to protect our Embassy in Islamabad and consulates in Lahore, Peshawar, and Karachi.
And I want to be clear, as I have said on numerous occasions, the violence we have seen cannot
be tolerated. There is no justification for violence. Of course, there is provocation, and we have
certainly made clear that we do not in any way support provocation. We found the video that's at
the core of this series of events offensive, disgusting, reprehensible.
But that does not provide justification for violence, and therefore it is important for responsible
leaders, indeed responsible people everywhere, to stand up and speak out against violence and
particularly against those who would exploit this difficult moment to advance their own
extremist ideologies.
Yesterday afternoon when I briefed the Congress, I made it clear that keeping our people
everywhere in the world safe is our top priority. What happened in Benghazi was a terrorist
attack, and we will not rest until we have tracked down and brought to justice the terrorists who
murdered four Americans. And we are taking aggressive measures at all of our posts to protect
our staffs and their families along with locally employed people who provide so many important
contributions to the work of our missions.
The Foreign Minister and I will have a chance to cover a full range of subjects today, and it is no
secret that the past year and a half has been challenging for Pakistan and the United States. And
we still have work to do to get our bilateral relationship to the point where we would like it to be,
but we both recognize that we can achieve more when we work together on a focused agenda. So

today is the latest in a series of high-level meetings. Ambassador Marc Grossman has just
returned from consultations in Islamabad. I look forward to seeing President Zardari next week
at the UN General Assembly. At each meeting, we are working to identify the strategic goals we
share — and there are many — and the concrete actions we can each take to accomplish them.
Our number one shared priority remains pursuing our joint counterterrorism objectives to ensure
the security of American and Pakistani citizens alike. We face a common threat from a common
enemy, and we must confront terrorism and extremism together. Earlier this month, I designated
the Haqqani Network as a Foreign Terrorist Organization so we could make full use of every
available legal authority to end their deadly attacks. Pakistan's parliament has called for
expelling foreign fighters so that Pakistan's territory can be fully under control of the Pakistani
Government and cannot be used to launch attacks against other nations.
And the follow-through on this is challenging but necessary, and we look forward to working
with Pakistan as they continue to address these problems. We have both pledged to support a
secure, stable, and prosperous Afghanistan, which is vital for the security of the region. And I
want to thank Foreign Minister Khar for Pakistan's reopening of the NATO supply lines to allow
the movement of goods to Afghanistan.
We will discuss the successful first meeting of the Safe Passage Working Group in Islamabad
which brought together Afghan, Pakistani, and U.S. representatives to advance the peace process
in Afghanistan. The Pakistani Government's public call for insurgents to come forward and talk
with the Afghan Government was particularly important. We are ready to work together to build
on these steps, and we will continue our discussions through bilateral consultations and the U.S.-
Afghanistan-Pakistan Core Group.
Now, of course, our relationship goes far beyond our shared security concerns, and today we will
discuss the many other ways in which we work together, particularly to create economic
opportunity for Pakistanis. Foreign Minister Khar and I agree that we need to shift our economic
relationship from aid to trade and investment. We are working to help Pakistan attract more
private sector investment. We hope to finalize a bilateral investment treaty soon. And we've
created a Pakistan private investment initiative to help more of Pakistan's small and medium
sized companies get access to capital.
Over the past few years, we have seen Pakistan's civilian government begin to put down stronger
roots. And if elections proceed as planned next year, it will mark the first time in Pakistan's
history that a civilian-led government has served its full term. The United States supports
Pakistan's economic development, and we have said many times that we want to see democracy
succeed in Pakistan.

We also support Pakistan's sovereignty, but we are clear that all sovereign nations carry certain
obligations to protect the human rights of their citizens, to control their territory, to prevent
threats to their neighbors and the international community.
So we know that there is still much to be done, but I can assure the people of Pakistan that the
United States remains committed to this important relationship and we are confident we can
continue to move forward together one step at a time to reach our shared strategic objectives.
Thank you very much.
Remarks With Tunisian Foreign Minister Rank Abdessalem Before Their Meeting
September 21, 2012
SECRETARY CLINTON: Good morning. I am pleased to welcome the Foreign Minister from
Tunisia I'm looking forward to our meeting, We obviously have a great deal to discuss, and I
want to thank the Foreign Minister and the Government of Tunisia for their efforts over the last
week to help secure our Embassy and the American Cooperative School of Tunis following the
violent assaults of last Friday.
We are monitoring events closely today. There is no higher priority for President Obama and
myself than the safety of our people. We've taken a number of steps around the world to
augment security and to protect our personnel at diplomatic posts. And we are working closely
with host governments in this effort.
As I have said before and as is embodied in the Vienna Convention and other international
agreements, all governments have the duty, the solemn duty, to defend diplomatic missions.
They must be safe and protected places so that governments can exchange views and work on
many important issues, and leaders across the world must stand up and be counted in rejecting
violence and holding violent actors accountable.
We are working closely with the Government of Tunisia They have assisted us in enhancing the
security of our facilities. We've also discussed with them the imperative of bringing to justice
those responsible for these violent attacks. And we have offered and will continue to look for
ways that we can assist the new Government of Tunisia in ensuring the rule of law throughout
their country, first and foremost for the people of Tunisia themselves. We look forward to
continuing to build our hew partnership with the Tunisian Government and people. Our
relationship is built around the shared principles of all democracies — a commitment to
nonviolence, to tolerance, and inclusivity for all people, and to upholding the rule of law.
The Tunisian people have bravely put themselves on the road to democracy. They were the first
of the Arab revolutions and they have made important progress in a very short period of time.
They have worked too hard and sacrificed too much over too many years to see their progress

Tunisia but in too many places around the world, look for opportunities to exploit this current
situation or other situations, and all people and leaders must stand against them.
So as the Tunisian Government takes steps to strengthen security and protect the Tunisian people
and economy from extremism and violent agendas, the United States stands ready to help. We
also are working closely with Tunisia on the broader shared threat of terrorism, including from
groups like al-Qaida and its affiliates.
So Minister, please know the United States remains committed to supporting Tunisia as you deal
with this current situation, as you continue your democratic transition, and we want to be with
you as you confront challenges and help seize opportunities together for the betterment of the
future of Tunisia.

Subject: RE: HRC friend
jeff thanks for reminding me. The Al-Keeb government is clearly facing many crises, the major one being the inability so
far to implement what appeared to be fairly detailed plans by Minister of Interior Fauzi and Minister of Defense Juwaili to
incorporate 25k thuwar each (total 75k) into the security forces, armed forces and into the private sector (jobs, training,
education). the main obstacles appear to be inability to implement plans by any of the GOL ministers so far and lack of
funds although we hope there will be a solution to that soon. Also, none of the militias appears willing to budge without
seeing some proof that others are also willing to do so.
I am not sure about HRC contact ascribing these problems mainly to Bel-Haj, whose star we believed had fallen over the
past several weeks. The Islamists are demanding their share of the political pie like everyone else-no more and no less. I
met with a Libyan contact yesterday who had just met with an Islamist-led militiaman from Zintan. The leader of this group
demanded that women's role be inscribed in the constitution as per Sharia'-if that did not happen this guy threatened to
take up arms again. Sarkis-the new but now deposed Economy Minister is an example of the power of the street and
different voices clamoring for different things. He was a technocrat whom we dealt with in the past but because of the
perception that he was "part of the old regime" he had to go even though al-Keeb regretted the decision since Sarkis was
an able technocrat. So, the bottom line is that the disarming and reintegration of the militias is not going as well as we
would have liked though the Minister of Interior told me on the margins of the PM discussion with DDCI Morrell today that
things on that score were going "well." One positive ray of light is that Tripoli Local Council reps told us today that they
had begun registering thuwar to determine which of the three possible categories they could stream into. Another
disturbing trned which may be happening is the emergence of organized crime perhaps fueled by old regime elements
including Snussi and al-Baghdadi. According to MOI sources have expressed real concern about an unholy
alliance of former Qadhafi loyalists, criminals who escaped from prison, and odd assortments of different thuwar. They are
apparently getting money, terrorizing the cities by night and engaging in human trafficking, drugs, gunrunning and alcohol
backed by old regime money. The motivation would be economic and political (creating chaos and undermining
stability). Our Legatt reps will meet with the e the Brits tomorrow to see if we can respond to MOI request for help in
training a team to deal with this possible new and troubling phenomenon. Not sure whether this crime phenomenon is
connected to the murder of my good friend Hugo deSamie, a french businessman who had been involved in deals with
the old regime and was back trying his hand with the new group.
It is not clear whether he will survive given the
intense pressure the PM is coming under from the eastern Obeidi tribes-they want one of theirs in the position as
compensation for the murder of Yusuf Obeidi.

So bottom line, there is ferment and things are not progressing as fast and as far as we would like. But let's not panic yet-
the PM is well-intentioned and the ministers are able people if they can get the means to implement their plans. Itold the
PM today that we could help in various areas and that we could be as discrete as need be in light of his formidable
political vulnerabilities. By the way, he may be planning to visit Washington and NY end of January-ealry February period.

Another friend of 1-111Cs offers the following assessment/report from a source. HRC interested in your views.
SOURCE: Sources with direct access to the Libyan National Transitional Council, as well as the highest levels
of European Governments, and Western Intelligence and security services.
1.During the last week of December 2011, and the first week of2012, Libya'sPrime Minister
Abdurrahim el-Keib and President Mustafa Abdul Jai engaged in a series of emergency planning meetings
attempting to deal with specific issues threatening the stability of the new National Transitional Council (NTC)
Government. According to extremely sensitive sources speaking in strict confidence, paramount among these
issues are the questions of disarming and rewarding the regional militias who bore the majority of the fighting
against the regime of Muammar al Qaddafi, as well as the related issue of finding ministers and senior
administrators for the new government who are acceptable to these revolutionary forces. These individuals
noted that on four occasions, beginning on December 23, 2011, groups or angry militiamen came to el-Keib's
office and demanded better treatment, a clear message of support for the role of Islamic law, and the removal
of former Qaddafi advisors from the new government.
2. (Source Comment: In the opinion of a very sensitive source, el-Keib is genuinely concerned that this
situation could spiral out of control and threatens the regime. He also suspects that much of the unrest is being
stirred by General Abdel Hakim Alamin Belhaj and his conservative Islamist supporters. By staying out of the
new government, Belhaj has established a position from which he can criticize their actions and appointments
without concern or control. That said, el — Keib has been told by his contacts in the Moslem Brotherhood (MB)
that even Belhaj has been surprised that the unrest in the militias has begun to manifest itself in fighting
between groups that previously shared the same goals and operated under Belhaj's loose command. This is
particularly true in the case of the increasingly violent conflicts between the Misrata and Zintan regional
militias.)
3. Inan effort to address these problems el-Keib is making changes in his new administration, removing
Minister of Economics Taher Sherkaz, who, as a former economic advisor to Qaddafi, was a particular target of
the militiamen. In the opinion of well informed individuals, el-Keib's closest and most influential advisors are
experts with economic backgrounds and experience dealing with Western firms and governments. The most
influential of this group are Minister of Oil Abdulrahman Ben Yezza, Minister of Finance Hassan Ziglam,
National Oil Company chief Nuni Berrusien, and Ngteb Obeda from the Libyan Stock Exchange.
4. (Source Comment: In the opinion of a very sensitive source, el-Keib and Jalil are also very concerned
over growing criticism that these technocrats are puppets of various Western governments and firms. Belhaj

and the militiamen appear intent on limiting the influence of these Western entities, using them as a weapon to
weaken the el-Keib regime. This trend is also affecting national security, where, despite el-Keila's efforts to
maintain a balance between the Islamists, regional commanders, and the national army, a potentially
dangerous conflict has arisen over the position of Chief of Staff of the National Army. El-Kieb, according to this
individual, believes that he must settle this matter in short order to avoid provoking security concerns among
foreign allies and businesses contacts.)
5. According to a knowledgeable individual, in late December aotiel-Kieb resisted efforts by General
Khalifa Belgasint Hefter to establish himself as the Chief of Staff of the National Army. Hefter, who lived in the
United States for manyyears and is believed by Belhaj and others to have a relationship with the U.S.
Government, is using his popularity among the officer corps of the regular NTC army to support his claim to be
Chief of Staff. This produced heated protests from militia leaders and in late December 2011e1-Keib named
deputy Minister of Defense Colonel Yussef al-Mangoush, to be Chief of Staff. In the opinion of one source, this
is a problematic choice, since el-Keib is replacing the supposedly pro-American Haftar with al-Mangoush who
commanded one of Qaddafi's elite Special Forces units, even after the revolution began. This individual
believes that el-Keib's decision was driven by personal animosity toward Haftar, and the influence of Minister
of Defense Osama alehiwali. The situation is far from resolved, as Haftar and his supporters, particularly in
the Benghazi garrison, continue to claim that the General is the true Chief of Staff. El-Keib and aleruwali are
working to reconcile all of the elements in this conflict as quickly as possible, before the supporters of the two
claimants begin fighting. In the meantime, el-Keib has stated in private that he fully expects Belhaj to attack
al-Mangoush, but the Prime Minister believes that the Colonel is the only officer strong enough to disarm the
militias and avoid a civil war.
6. At the same time, a very sensitive source added that el-Keila and Jalil are attempting to reconcile the
fighting between Misrata and Zintan forces in Tripoli by naming Misrata leader Fawzi Abd All as Minister of
the Interior and alsJuwali, who was commander of the Zintan militia„ as Minister of Defense. To date,
according to this individual, this effort has met with limited success, as the fighting has continued and the
militias are refusing to disarm until their demands regarding living standards are met.
7. (Source Comment: One very sensitive source noted, that el-Keib is aware of the fact that he is
running out of time to stabilize the situation in Libya. He believes that if he does not disarm the militias and
meet their demands in the next six months there is a good chance of increased fighting among rival groups that
could lead to civil war. In any event, he realizes that the ongoing instability will cause Western governments,
firms, and banks, to hesitate before committing themselves to long term relationships with Libya. El-Keib
believes that Belhaj and his advisors have made the same judgment, and are waiting to fill any vacuum created
by this violence, by establishing a conservative Islamic Republic.)

Hi Philippe:
Thanks very much for the note. I appreciate it.
I have deep sympathy for what your team and the families of the victims are going through. In Baghdad years
ago, someone I cared for very deeply lost her life with three others in the service of promoting our values
overseas. This experience probably added to the intensity behind my questions and responses as well.
In the interest of diplomacy and extending an olive branch: we should get a drink sometime, off the record.

Subject: Inquiry Into Libya Attack Is Sharply Critical of State Dept. (NYT)
WASHINGTON (New York Times) - An independent inquiry into the attack on the United States diplomatic
mission in Libya that killed four Americans on Sept. 11 sharply criticizes the State Department for a lack of
seasoned security personnel and relying on untested local militias to safeguard the compound, Congressional
and State Department officials said Tuesday night
The investigation into the attacks on the diplomatic mission and C.LA. annex that killed Ambassador I.
Christopher Stevens and three others also faulted State Department officials in Washington for ignoring
requests from officials at the American Embassy in Tripoli for more guards and safety upgrades to the
diplomatic mission.
The panel also blamed the State Department for waiting for specific warnings of imminent attacks to act
rather than adapting security procedures and protocols to a deteriorating security environment By this spring,
Benghazi, a hotbed of militant activity in eastern Libya, had experienced a string of assassinations and attacks,
including one on a British envoy's motorcade.
Finally, the report also blamed two major State Department bureaus — diplomatic security and Near Eastern
affairs — for failing to coordinate and plan adequate security at the mission. The panel also determined that a
number of officials had shown poor leadership.
In response to the panel's findings, Secretary of State Hillary Rodhana Clinton said in a letter to Congress
that she was acceptiung all 29 of the panel's recommendations, several of which are classified.
Mrs. Clinton is taking specific steps to correct the problems, according to officials. They say the State
Department is asking permission from Congress to transfer $1.3 billion from funds that had been allocated for
spending in Iraq. This includes $553 million for additional Marine security guards; $130 million for diplomatic
security personnel; and $691 million for improving security at installations abroad.
On Monday, an independent panel that was established to investigate the attack presented the report to the
State Department. The panel, called an accountability review board, is led by Thomas R. Pickering, a veteran
diplomat. It includes four other members, among them Mike Mullen, the retired admiral who served as
chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff. The board is authorized by a 1986 lavv intended to strengthen security at
United States diplomatic missions.
The State Department sent a lengthy classified version of the report to Congress on Tuesday. Mr. Pickering
and Admiral Mullen are scheduled to meet with members of the Senate Foreign Relations Committee and
House Foreign Affairs Committee in closed session on Wednesday.
On Thursday, William J. Burns and Thomas R Nides, both deputy secretaries of States, will testitY to both
panels. Mrs. Clinton, who is stillrecovering from a concussion she suffered last week after fainting while sick
from a stomach flu, is at home this week. The head of the House panel, Representative Ileana Ros-Lehtinen, a
Florida Republican, however, has made clear that she planned to ask Mrs. Clinton to testify at a future time

Benghazi's Deep Throat fingers Islamist Leaders for
Attacks as State Dept Criticized on Consular Security
Posted on 12/19/2012 by Juan
The report saying that security was inadequate at the compound that the US had adopted as its ad hoc
consulate in 13enghazio Libya dominates today's headlines. That conclusion is obvious. The
"consulate" was just a private residence taken over for this purpose by the US in the city, It was not
constructed to be a US government building in a potentially hostile city.
I met a person who worked there when I was in Benghazi in June, and she told me that it wasn't even
clear if the consulate would be retained after the first of this year It was possibly temporary,
depending on Congressional funding. (The Tea Party House hasn't been good on meeting requests for
embassy security funds).
The more interesting question than why ad hoc arrangements should have been made for a consulate
during and after the Libyan revolution (the answer to which seems fairly obvious) is, who is
responsible for the string of assassinations and acts of violence in the city, of which the RPG attack on
the consulate on September 11 was only one? Benghazi, with a population of over one million in a
country of 6.5 million, is Libya's second largest city and1/1
e'as the epicenter of the revolution against the
government of Muammar Qaddafi in 2011.
On November 22, Benghazi police chief Farej Darssi was assassinated. In October a police colonel
barely avoided death— his car was wired to explode, A Libyan intelligence officer was killed in
September. A general was assassinated in August. Some of these figures had worked for Qaddafi but
had defected to the revolution. Qaddafi's security forces were responsible for the 1996 massacre of
hardline fundamentalists at Abu Salim prison, and for making others just disappear, Likely the same
shadowy cells that attacked the US consulate are behind the attacks on Benghazi police and army
officers.
There may have been a break in the case. Last Saturday, Benghazi security forces loyal to the elected
government in Tripoli, captured a man they suspected of being involved with the groups behind the
violence. And, he appears to have been willing to spill the beans. So let's call him the Libyan Deep
Throat.
Deep Throat is so knowledgeable about the conspiracies facing the city and so dangerous to those
hatching them that the latter immediately attempted to spring him from jail.
On Sunday morning, militants attacked the police facility next to the holding cell where the man is
being detained. A policeman at that station died in a hail of bullets from the attackers, and they called
for back-up. The police car that sped to the scene as ambushed and three policemen in it were killed.
Still, the police stood their ground and fought off the assault, and they kept their valuable suspect in
custody, with all his valuable testimony.
Shortly after midnight, on Monday morning, small explosives were set off at the Garyounis police
station in Benghazi, damaging a couple of automobiles but otherwise doing little damage. Then
explosives were set off at al-Uruba police station, which also took sniper fire, but neither resulted in
casualties.

The police became vigilant, and they apprehended a shady-looking man skulking around near the al-
Hadaeg police station, finding him to have two rocket propelled grenades in his possession, which he
was apparently intending to fire at the station.
In other words, the capture of Libyan Deep Throat has set off a gang war on the police, who are being
informed by bombings and shootings that they must let their informant go or risk their
So what is Deep Throat saying? According to local journalist Mohamed Bujenah of the Libyan Herald,
a senior figure in the Benghazi police told him that the informant had fingered as many as 7
prominent Muslim fundamentalist leaders in connection with these attacks, of whom the police
named 6 explicitly:
1 Sufyan Ben Qumu, from the notoriously radical town of Derna, and a former prisoner at
Guantanamo
2.Ahmad Bukatela, leader of the ',Thai& Militia
3.Muhammad al-Zahawi, head of the Ansar al-Sharia militia
4.Muhammad al-Gharabi, a leader of the Rafallala al-Sahati Militia
5.Ismail Sallabi, another leader of Rafallah al-Sahati
6.Salim .Nabous, head of the Zawiya Martyrs' Brigade
It is just a newspaper article. We don't know if the informant actually named these individuals or if he
did so to escape torture, in which case we can't trust what he said. But if the allegations are true, there
is collusion among several hardline militias in the city to create instability in hopes of taking it over.
The new, elected, prime minister Ali Zeidan, has started asserting himself militarily. He closed the
country's southern borders against instability in the Sahel. He may well have some risky house
cleaning to do in Benghazi.

Re: Libya internal strife
SOURCE: Sources with direct access to the Libyan National Transitional Council, as well as the highest levels of
European Governments, and Western Intelligence and security services.
1. On the evening of January 22, 2012, according to an official with access to the leadership of the National
Transitional Government (NTC), Libyan President Mustafa Abdul Jalil spoke at length with Prime Minister Abdurrahim el-
Keib, stating in a heated exchange that el-Keib's government must take the steps necessary to address the complaints of
the demobilized fighters from the 2011revolution. Jalil pointed out that the new government has been discussing this
situation since it was formed in October 2011, and matters have now reached a crisis point with a group of more than
2,000 disgruntled veterans, supported by students, attacking the NTC offices in Benghazi on January 21, destroying
computer equipment and NTC files. These demonstrators, some of whom threw Molotov cocktails at the NTC
headquarters building, continue to demand better medical care, jobs, payment for their time in the revolutionary army, and
a commitment to transparency on the part of the el-Keib regime; particularly the appointment of cabinet members arid
senior officials.
2. According to this source, when el-Keib replied, pointing out that demonstrators were camped outside of his
office in Tripoli. He added that the government had to proceed in a measured and professional manner, Jalil stated in
angry tones, that NTC Staffers were beaten and could have been killed during the January 21 incident, pointing out that
this is how the rebellion against Muammar al Qaddafi began in February 2011. Jalil also warned that Islamist leader
General Abdel Hakim Alamin Belhaj and his supporters, particularly militia commanders from Zintan, Misrata, and other

western regions, are anxiously waiting for the NTC government to collapse. Their goal, in the opinion of this individual, is
to eventually move in and establish a strict Islamic state. Jalil, added that his contacts in the Egyptian Muslim
Brotherhood had been in touch during the preceding week, warning that the threat from Belhaj is very real. El-Keib stated
that he must press Minister of Defense Osama al-Juwali and Interior Minister Fawzi Abd Ali to be more efficient in
administering their positions. According to this individual, el-Keib fears that al-Juwali, who was a western commander
during the revolution, may be maintaining a secret relationship with Belhaj and his allies. In response, Jai warned el-Keib
to avoid trying to use the regular military forces posted around Benghazi under General Khalifa Beloasim Hefter in an
effort to restrain the former militia troops as such a step could lead to civil war.
3.(Source Comment: In the opinion of an extremely well placed individual, el-Keib is, in fact, increasingly
frustrated by the inefficiency in his regime and the inability of hie ministers and administrators to arrange contracts with
foreign firms. He complains that his principal advisors, Minister of Oil Abdulrahman Ben Yezza and Minister of Finance
Hassan Zigiam, have been too timid in resolving the questions associated with contracts involving foreign firms, both old
and new. At present it appearsthat whenever one official raises a question regarding an agreement the entire matter is
put on hold and delayed. In the opinion of this source, el-Kelb knows that without these agreements he cannot meet the
demands of the veterans and the students. El-Keib stated in confidence, that he may have made a serious mistake in
removing the former oil/finance minister All Tatham' from the government. El-Kelb also noted that Jalil is shaken by the
January 21 attack on NTC headquarters end is searching for ways to appease the demonstrators. Most recently he
asked Abdel - Haltdh Ghoza, his principal deputy and NiC spokesman to step down. Ghoza, who comes from the
Benghazi area, was particularly unpopular with the western troops.)
4. Following the discussion with Jalil, el-Kieb ordered Ziglarn and Ngeb Obedoi, the head of the Stock Exchange,
to move with all possible speed to address the issue of the foreign contracts and arrange for new vendors to provide the
services demanded by the veterans and students. In this discussion he pointed out that if they cannot deal with this
situation they will not have to worry about the national elections in 2012, Libya will be an Islamic Republic, with BeMO as
the ruler. El-Kalb pointed out that foreign governments and large oil firms must be aware of this threat and that this will
frighten them into meeting the conditions for foreign contracts set out by the NTC.
5. (Source Comment: According to an extremely sensitive source, el-Keib spoke secretly with Hefter, stating that
he, and those troops loyal to him, should be prepared to move to protect the government in the event of increased
violence. This effort could include moving against Belhaj and attacking militia forces before they can unite and
organize. El-Keib emphasized that this is for planning purposes only, and no action should be taken until el-Kelb gives
the order. He emphasized that he will do everything possible to avoid civil war, but he is now concerned that Jai will be
unable to deal with the level of hostility against the NTC, and cannot be counted on to take strong positions against Belhaj
and his supporters. In the opinion of this individual, el-Keib cannot back away from his commitment to technicians in
senior positions, but he will press them as hard as he can to have the government respond to the needs of the veterans
and students. El-Keib believes it is not too late to address these problems, but they must move quickly.)

Benghazi's Deep Throat fingers Islamist Leaders for
Attacks as State Dept Criticized on Consular Security
Posted on 12/19/2012 by Juan
The report saying that security was inadequate at the compound that the US had adopted as its ad hoc
consulate in Benghazi, Libya, dominates today's headlines. That conclusion is obvious. The
"consulate" was just a private residence taken over for this purpose by the US in the city. It was not
constructed to be a US government building in a potentially hostile city.
I met a person who worked there when I was in Benghazi in June, and she told me that it wasn't even
clear if the consulate would be retained after the first of this year. It was possibly temporary,
depending on Congressional funding. (The Tea Party House hasn't been good on meeting requests for
embassy security funds).
The more interesting question than why ad hoc arrangements should have been made for a consulate
during and after the Libyan revolution (the answer to which seems fairly obvious) is, who is
responsible for the string of assassinations and acts of violence in the city, of which the RPG attack on
the consulate on September 11 was only one? Benghazi, with a population of over one million in a
country of 6.5 million, is Libya's second largest city and was the epicenter of the revolution against the
government of Muammar Qaddafi in 2011.
On November 22, Benghazi police chief Farej Darssi was assassinated. In October a police colonel
barely avoided death— his car was wired to explode. A Libyan intelligence officer was killed in
September. A general was assassinated in August. Some of these figures had worked for Qaddafi but
had defected to the revolution. Qaddafi's security forces were responsible for the 1996 massacre of
hardline fundamentalists at Abu Salim prison, and for making others just disappear. Likely the same
shadowy cells that attacked the US consulate are behind the attacks on Benghazi police and army
officers.
There may have been a break in the case. Last Saturday, Benghazi security forces loyal to the elected
government in Tripoli, captured a man they suspected of being involved with the groups behind the
violence. And, he appears to have been willing to spill the beans. So let's call him the Libyan Deep
Throat.
Deep Throat is so knowledgeable about the conspiracies facing the city and so dangerous to those
hatching them that the latter immediately attempted to spring him from jail.

On Sunday morning, militants attacked the police facility next to the holding cell where the man is
being detained. A policeman at that station died in a hail of bullets from the attackers, and they called
for back-up. The police car that sped to the scene was ambushed and three policemen in it were killed.
Still, the police stood their ground and fought off the assault, and they kept their valuable suspect in
custody, with all his valuable testimony.
Shortly after midnight, on Monday morning, small explosives were set off at the Garyounis police
station in Benghazi, damaging a couple of automobiles but otherwise doing little damage. Then
explosives were set off at al-Uruba police station, which also took sniper fire, but neither resulted in
casualties.
The police became vigilant, and they apprehended a shady-looking man skulking around near the al-
Hadaeg police station, finding him to have two rocket propelled grenades in his possession, which he
was apparently intending to fire at the station.
In other words, the capture of Libyan Deep Throat has set off a gang war on the police, who are being
informed by bombings and shootings that they must let their infounant go or risk their
So what is Deep Throat saying? According to local journalist Mohamed Bujenah of the Libyan Herald,
a senior figure in the Benghazi police told him that the informant had fingered as many as 7
prominent Muslim fundamentalist leaders in connection with these attacks, of whom the police
named 6 explicitly:
1 Sayan Ben Quinu, from the notoriously radical town of Derna, and a former prisoner at
Guantanamo
2.Ahmad Bukatela, leader of the Mai& Militia
3.Muhammad al-Zahawi, head of the Ansar al-Sharia militia
4.Muhammad al-Gharabi, a leader of the Rafallah al-Sahafi Militia
5.Ismail Sallabi, another leader of Rafallah al-Sahati
6.Salim Nabous, head of the Zawiya Martyrs' Brigade
It is just a newspaper article. We don't kilow if the informant actually named these individuals or if he
did so to escape torture, in which case we can't trust what he said. But if the allegations are true, there
is collusion among several hardline militias in the city to create instability in hopes of taking it over.
The new, elected, prime minister Ali Zeidan, has started asserting himself militarily. He clod the
country's southern borders against instability in the Sahel. He may well have some risky house
cleaning to do in Benghazi.

Re: Libyan election
SOURCE: Sources with direct access to the Libyan National Transitional Council, as well as the highest levels of
European Governments, and Western Intelligence and security services.
1. Libyan National Transitional Council (NTC) President Mustafa Abdel Jalil expected the final days leading to the
July 7, 2012 national elections to be complicated and sometimes violent; however, according to a knowledgeable
individual, he is particularly concerned by the level of control exerted by regional militia's and political groups on the
electoral process. In the opinion of this individual, Jalil and his advisors believe that, given the level of suspicion and
frustration felt in the various parts of the country, it will be difficult for the new 200 seat General National Congress (GNC)
to establish its authority, draft a new constitution, and establish new national government. With this in mind, Jalil stated in
extreme confidence that the NTC may have to remain in power until the situation becomes stable and a new government
is firmly in place. That said he still plans to have interim Prime Minister Abdel Rahman el-Keib step down after the
election results have been certified. The NTC will then work with the GNC as it takes shape to choose a new Prime
Minister and Cabinet. Jalil would like to keep several ministers from the el-Keib government in the new regime,
particularly Minister of Defense Ousama al-Juwali.
2. According to this individual, Jalil wants to maintain a degree of security and stability in an effort to reassure
foreign businesses and banks that Libya will not descend into civil war and chaos. At the same time, the NTC must deal
with the regional issues that divide the country's three electoral regions: Tripolitania in the West, Cyrenaica (Barge) in the
East, and Fezzan in the South. In the weeks leading up to the election the failure of the NTC to resolve these differences
has strengthened the federalist movement in Barge while antagonizing the tribal leaders in the South. Both groups are
calling on their followers to boycott the election while the Southerners are calling for the National Army to withdraw its
forces from the area around the town of Kufra, where they are deployed to stop fighting between tribal militias. At the
same time, on July 1 federalist supporters attacked electoral offices in Benghazi, protesting the influence of Tripoli and the
Western region on the upcoming elections.

3. (Source Comment: In the opinion of a knowledgeable individual, the division of the 200 seats in the GNC lies
at the heart of this matter, with 120 seats allotted for the Tripolitania, 60 for Barqa, and 18 for the Fezzan area. At
present, the Libyan Muslim Brotherhood (LMB) and its political arm, the Justice and Construction Party (JCP), are
attempting to mount a national campaign, receiving discreet advice and technical support from the Egyptian Muslim
Brotherhood (EMB). With this assistance, Jalil is convinced that the JCP is the party that operates most effectively
throughout the country. Jalil has established ties to the EMB, from whom he has learned that JCP leader Mohamad
Sowan and his associates are working with the leadership of the EMB.)
4. According to his sources, Jalil believes that he can work with Sowan and the LMB/JCP; however, he is
concerned that Mohammed Morsi, the newly elected EMB President of Egypt, and EMB Supreme Guide Mohammed
Badie are focused on developing Egyptian influence in Libya. Jalil has been informed privately that these EMB leaders
want to establish a strong position in Libya, particularly in the oil services sector as part of their effort to improve Egypt's
economic situation. Libyan officials in Cairo and Jalil's own associates are warning him that the Egyptians may see the
NTC as a potential barrier to their effort and are advising Sowan to press for an early withdrawal of Jalil and the NTC from
Libyan politics. For his part, Jalil has attempted to avoided direct conflict with the LMB/JCP, focusing his attention, and
that of the el-Keib interim government on trying to deal with the unrest in the period leading up to the national elections.
5. According to a particularly sensitive source, Jalil believes that Sowan will need the assistance of the Libyan
National Party (LNP), the Islamist group led by religious scholar Ali al-Salabi and former Islamist militant
General Abdel Hakim Alamin Belhaj to gain enough seats to control the GNC. While there are significant personal
conflicts between Sowan and Belhaj, Jalil believes that the two groups could work together to gain control of the
government. In this case, Jalil believes the new regime would move quickly to oust the NTC, and establish a more
conservative Islamist regime. At the same time, since the LNP is a Tripoli based movement, Jalil fears that the tribal
federalists in Barqa might react violently to them gaining an important role in the new government. Since the Barqa
leaders are urging their followers to boycott the election, a strong role for the LNP in coalition with the LMB/JCB could
lead to calls for Barge to secede from the Libya. (Source Comment: The LNP is dominated by the former leaders of the
Libyan Islamic Fighting Group (AI-Jamala al-Islamiyyah —LIFG), who, according to sensitive sources, maintained ties to al
Qa'ida during their struggle with the forces of former dictator Muammar al Qaddafi.)
6. Former interim Prime Minister Mahmoud Jibril is leading the National Forces Alliance (NFA),
an umbrella coalition of liberal parties that received Western support for efforts to overthrow the regime of Muammar al
Qaddafi. While Jibril is not on the list of candidates, his presence in the NFA leadership is seen by Belhaj and other
Islamists as an effort by the United States and Western Europe to manipulate the election. Jalil does not believe that the
NFA can gain control of enough seats in parliament to play a significant role in the new government. According to this
source, Jalil believes that former Oil and Finance Minister Ali Tarhouni also plays an important role in the NFA.
7. At the same time, Jafil is watching the progress of a second moderate party, the National Front (NF), which is
based on the work of a 1980s-era anti-Qaddafi exile organization. The party is led by Mohammed al-Magariaf, an exiled
intellectual dissident leader from a prominent Eastern Libyan family. Jalil's sources advise that the NF is also backed by
the al-Sennusi tribe, the former Libyan royal family, who may be looking to play a role in a semi-autonomous or
independent Barqa. One particularly sensitive source noted that many of the NF leaders have ties to the United States,
Italy and the United Kingdom, and at one point Jalil believed that the NF might be able to work with the NFA; however,
personal differences between the leaders of the two parties made effective cooperation difficult.
8. (Source Comment: In the end, a particularly sensitive source stated in confidence that Jalil believes the
LMB/JCB will have a significant role in the new government, possibly supported by the LNP. However; he points out that
since accurate polling is nonexistent it is impossible to predict a victor with any accuracy. Jaill also noted that it is quite
possible that no group will win a clear victory, which, when added to the boycotts and pre-election violence may require
the NTC maintain control of the country for some time to come. Accordingly, he has instructed al-Juwali to prepare to use
the National Army to maintain order. For his part Al-Juwali has warned that this will be a difficult task since the best units
of the Army, including many of its armored forces are deployed in the Kufra region of the Southeast, in an effort to control
tribal conflicts, stem the flow of weapons into the country from South Sudan, and resist Qaddafi loyalists amongst the
nomadic tribes of the region.)

Another report--
SOURCE: Sources with direct access to the Libyan National Transitional Council, as well as the highest levels of
European Governments, and Western Intelligence and security services.
1. As of the morning of July 6, an individual with access to the information stated in confidence that Libyan National
Transitional Council (NTC) President Mustafa Abdel Jalil remains committed to a transfer of power to a popularly elected
government; however, he is prepared to ex-tend the life of the NTC as a guarantor of stability for the Libyan people
following the July 7, 2012 election for seats in a 200-member General National Congress (GNC). Jaifi realizes that 2.7
million Libyans have registered to vote and are generally anxious to replace the increasingly unpopular NTC. That said,
JAI expects the voting to lead to a period of confusion and he will not abandon his authority until the results are fixed.
2. Jalil is also frustrated by the fact that during its eight-month tenure of the administration of Prime Minister Abclel
Rahman el-Keib - who was appointed by the NTC was unable to provide solutions for Libya's long list of needs: a
functioning justice system, a reconciliation process for officials who served the old administration, the disarming of
militia, building functional national security forces, rebuilding destroyed areas, and delivering basic services such as
healthcare.
3. At the same time, outside of the oil sector, much of Libya's economy is stagnant, and in the opinion of Western
security officials, lacks the government's go-ahead to restart public sector infrastructure contracts. In addition,
international advisers and foreign investors are reluctant to return to an environment where the government will not
sign long term agreements and cannot guarantee security.
4.(Source Comment: According to an extremely sensitive source, Jalil continues to believe that this chaotic situation
should not be surprising. He regularly points out that eight months is not a sufficient amount of time to build functioning
institutions from the remnants of the regime of former dictator Muammar al Qaddafi. The old regime featured a
dysfunctional bureaucracy, idiosyncratic rule, and anti-institutionalism. Additionally, Jaill now re
Ializes that due to
pronounced incompetence and a lack of will to take unpopular decisions the el-Keib government also failed to make
progress in the few areas where it could have achieved meaningful change. The towns of Sirte and Tawargha are
representative of the situation in the countryside where people lost their homes in the conflict and have been living in
temporary camps with limited ability to register and vote in their home district. Jalil has been urged by contacts in the
French and Italian Governments to guarantee the rights of people across the country in particular, he has serious
concerns as to whether or not supporters of former dictator Muammar al Qaddafi in his hometown of Sirte will be
included in the future political processes of the new Libya; if they are not allowed to vote by local militiamen. At the
same time, the fighting between Libyan Arabs and Tebta tribesmen in the Kufra area threatens to prevent any voting
there. Jalil has been warned that the NTC regulations now state that members of the National Army are not allowed to
vote or run for office, which is a disincentive for armed militia brigade members to become legitimate soldiers.)
5.This well informed individual believes that despite these flaws, the new government created by the July 7 election will
eventually have the mandate to take the difficult decisions that can create a reconciliation process. Jalil will work to
maintain order in this transition period, and finally reach his goal of creating a situation where the government can
rebuild homes and restore sufficient law and order; allowing those in Sirte, Tawargha, Kufra, and throughout the rest of
the country to live in their hometowns, establishing a situation where a true civil society can develop.

unable to provide it. That said, Jail! and Minister of Defense Ousarna alefuwali have pledged to provide 30,000 to 40,000
security personnel for election day to prevent similar incidents to the July 1 attack on Benghazi's election headquarters.
In that case eastern federalists entered the building, where ballot papers were burned and ballot boxes destroyed.
Similarly, these federalist forces are suspected of the attack on July 5 that burned down Ajdabiya's main storage centre
for election materials.

been proven that they were members of the self-appointed Cyrenaican National Council (MC), whose military arm set
up a roadblock in Wadi al-Ahmar on Libya's major east-west highway to demand that Cyrenaica get as many seats in the
GNC as Tripolitania. Thus far, neither the CNC nor any other group has publicly stated that they intend to use violence to
disrupt the elections. (Note: Under the current system Tripolitania will have 120 seats in the GNC, Cyrenaica (Barge) 62,
and Fezzan in the South 18.)

SOURCE: Sources with direct access to the Libyan National Transitional Council, as well as the highest levels of
European Governments, and Western Intelligence and security services.
1. As of the morning of July 6, an individual with access to the information stated in confidence that Libyan National
Transitional Council (NTC) President Mustafa Abdel Jalil remains committed to a transfer of power to a popularly elected
government; however, he is prepared to extend the life of the NTC as a guarantor of stability for the Libyan people
following the July 7, 2012 election for seats in a 200-member General National Congress (GNC). Jalil realizes that 2.7
million Libyans have registered to vote and are generally anxious to replace the increasingly unpopular NTC. That said,
Jalil expects the voting to lead to a period of confusion and he will not abandon his authority until the results are fixed.
2. Jalil is also frustrated by the fact that during its eight-month tenure of the administration of Prime Minister Abdel
Rahman el-Keib - who was appointed by the NTC — was unable to provide solutions for Libya's long list of needs: a
functioning justice system, a reconciliation process for officials who served the old administration, the disarming of
militia, building functional national security forces, rebuilding destroyed areas, and delivering basic services such as
healthcare.
3. At the same time, outside of the oil sector, much of Libya's economy is stagnant, and in the opinion of Western
security officials, lacks the government's go-ahead to restart public sector infrastructure contracts. In addition,
international advisers and foreign investors are reluctant to return to an environment where the government will not
sign long term agreements and cannot guarantee security.
4. (Source Comment: According to an extremely sensitive source, Jalil continues to believe that this chaotic situation
should not be surprising. He regularly points out that eight months is not a sufficient amount of time to build functioning
institutions from the remnants of the regime of former dictator Muammar al Qaddafi. The old regime featured a
dysfunctional bureaucracy, idiosyncratic rule, and anti-institutionalism. Additionally, Jalil now realizes that due to
pronounced incompetence and a lack of will to take unpopular decisions the el-Keib government also failed to make
progress in the few areas where it could have achieved meaningful change. The towns of Sirte and Tawargha are
representative of the situation in the countryside where people lost their homes in the conflict and have been living in
temporary camps with limited ability to register and vote in their home district. Jalil has been urged by contacts in the
French and Italian Governments to guarantee the rights of people across the country. In particular, he has serious
concerns as to whether or not supporters of former dictator fv1uammar al Qaddafi in his hometown of Sirte will be
included in the future political processes of the new Libya; if they are not allowed to vote by local militiamen. At the
same time the fighting between Libyan Arabs and Tebu tribesmen in the Kufra area threatens to prevent any voting

there. Jalil has been warned that the NTC regulations now state that members of the National Army are not allowed to
vote or run for office, which is a disincentive for armed militia brigade members to become legitimate soldiers.)
5.This well informed individual believes that despite these flaws, the new government created by the July 7 election will
eventually have the mandate to take the difficult decisions that can create a reconciliation process. Jalil will work to
maintain order in this transition period, and finally reach his goal of creating a situation where the government can
rebuild homes and restore sufficient law and order; allowing those in Sirte, Tawargha, Kufra, and throughout the rest of
the country to live in their hometowns, establishing a situation where a true civil society can develop.

Jake - Thanks for this. Tracks with what we are hearing about elections and the weakness of the interim govt. Elections
are going smoothly throughout most of Libya (Ajdabiya being the exception, where some ballots were sabotaged
requiring voting in some centers to be postponed for a few hours). Factoring in time to tally votes and process appeals,
the UN and the Libyan elections commission are anticipating announcing final results by late July. The expectation is
that the TNC will remain in power until the new congress is seated.
Sett McCain and I toured the new parliament this afternoon, where we encountered a TNC member, an engineer and a
couple of UN experts reviewing progress on the interior decor of the main chamber. They are racing to get the chamber
finished in time for the first session. The UN is offering technical assistance to the secretariat of the new congress,
ranging from parliamentary procedure to legislative drafting. They're even helping to plot out the choreography of the
first sessions.
The atmosphere in Tripoli is very festive. The gov't declared today a holiday and people are driving around honking and
waving flags and making peace sign gestures. We visited several polling stations where we found people patiently
waiting in lines (gender segregated) lvlcCain was applauded and thanked for his support wherever we went.

Re: New President of Libya
SOURCE: Sources with direct access to the Libyan National Transitional Council, as well as the
highest levels of European Governments, and Western Intelligence and security services.
1. (Source Comment: As the new interim President of Libya Mohammed Yussef el Magariaf is
determined to establish a democratic state based on Islamic principles. In the opinion of an
extremely sensitive source, Magariaf sees this moment as the climax his entire life's work. Having
first served deposed dictator Muammar al Qaddafi as a policy advisor and diplomat, in 1979 Magariaf
became disenchanted with what he saw as the cult of personality that Qaddafi was building for
himself while turning against the basic beliefs of the Islamist movement. Magariaf was member of the
Egyptian Muslim Brotherhood in his student days and remains a devout Islamist intellectual, albeit
one who believes that Islam can coexist and even work with the non-Muslim world, particularly the
United States and Western Europe. This source also believes that Magariaf is convinced that Libya,
with its great natural wealth, can become a leading player in North Africa, as well as the rest of the
Islamic world. Magariaf is particularly well disposed toward the governments of the United States
and France, based on past experiences with each during his struggle with Qaddafi. This source also
believes that he remains hostile to the government of Omar al Bashir in Sudan. In 1989 Bashir
overthrew Magariafs ally, then Sudanese Prime Minister Sadiq al-Mahdi and expelled Magariaf and
his followers from Khartoum.)

2. According to the same sensitive source, Magariaf will also seek a discreet relationship with
Israel. Political realities in Libya at present will dictate that this relationship be handled in a low key
manner, but the new President of Libya shares many common friends and associates with the leaders
of Israel and intends to take advantage of this situation to improve the lot of the Libyan people.
Magariaf may, at times, be forced to make statements critical of Israel for his own political purposes,
but believes he and his associates have the experience and sophistication to manage this issue. At the
same time Magariaf intends to pursue aggressively the regional political initiatives begun by National
Transitional Council (NTC) President Mustafa Abdel Jail. Magariaf will pursue the economic and
security cooperation set out in the Cairo Declaration of July 29, 2012 establishing a regional bond
between the new revolutionary governments of Tunisia, Libya and Egypt. This same individual notes
that Magariaf is aware of the fact that Egyptian President Mohammed Morsi sees Libya as a key factor
in Egypt's economic development; and the Libyan leader believes he can manipulate this situation to
the advantage of the Libyan people.
3. A separate sensitive source stated on condition of strict secrecy that Magariaf intends to
work with his security advisors to develop a plan for disarming the Islamist militias who fought
against Qaddafi, without arousing their suspicion. He believes that the most important step in this
matter will be providing the medical and economic services demanded by these militias in return for
disarming. Magariaf also believes that he can manage the political ambitions of Islamist leaders like
General Abdelhakim Belhaj, while preventing the growth of radical groups who might see Libya as a
base of operations and support. Magariaf and his supporters believe that his Islamist/anti-Qaddafi
credentials will allow him to manage these challenges, and if he can do so he will be able to win the
presidency outright in the first full scale national presidential election in the spring of 2013.
4. This source adds that, while avoiding direct involvement in the Syrian crisis, the Magariaf
government will support Turkey, Qatar, Saudi Arabia, and the rest of the nations calling for the end of
the regime of Basher al Assad. Magariaf harbors a particular sense of hostility toward Assad, who was
a longtime ally of Qaddafi, supporting him with equipment, intelligence, and advisors throughout the
revolution of 2011. Magariaf realizes that this stance will also bring him into conflict with Syria's ally
Iran, but does not believe Iran has a role to play in Libya, or the rest of North Africa,
5. According to an extremely sensitive source, in 1979 Magariaf, having become increasingly
disenchanted with Qaddafi, fled Libya for Khartoum in Sudan, where in 1981, with the help of the
government of Prime Minister Sadiq al-Mahdi, Chadian leader Hissene Habre, Iraqi President
Sadaam Hussein, and several Western states, he established The National Front for the Salvation of
Libya (NFSL), dedicated to overthrowing Qaddafi and establishing an Islamic democracy in Libya.
Under the auspices of the NFSL, Magariaf also organized the Libyan National Army (LNA), based in
Ndjarnena, Chad. The LNA was commanded by the Colonel Khalifa Belqasim Haftar, who is now one
of the commanding generals of the new Libyan Army. Under Magariaf s authority the Haftar force,
which numbered between 2,500 and 3,000 troops, fought several battles with Qaddafi's troops, with
mixed results. These attacks included a raid on Qaddafi's compound at Bab al-Aziza in 1986. The
LNA also maintained a 50,000 watt radio station in Ndjamena, broadcasting anti-Qaddafi material
into Libya. This radio station was supported by Western governments and Iraqi Military Intelligence.
6. The LNA's greatest success came in support of the Chadian Army under General Idriss
Deby, in their overwhelming victory over Libyan troops at the battle Ouadi Doum in 1987. This
victory forced the Libyan Army and Air Force out of Chad, and was supported by the French Air Force
and other Western personnel. Following the battle Deby became a national hero in Chad. In 1990,
with the support of Libyan intelligence officers, Deby, who had undergone military training in Libya
and France, rebelled against and overthrew the Habre Government. At that time Deby, under
Qaddafi's influence, forced the LNA to abandon Chad for Zaire, and eventually the United States.
Magariaf and Haftar both settled in the United States, and while the LNA no longer existed as an

effective force, Magariaf continued to maintain the NFSL as a political organization. In 2004
Magariaf and the NFSL joined the National Conference for the Libyan Opposition (NCLO), eventually
returning to support the 2011 revolution.
7. (Source Comment: In the opinion of an extremely sensitive source speaking on condition of
strict secrecy, Magariaf views himself as an Islamist politician who can work with both Islamic and
non-Islamic states, including Israel, if the relationships are properly managed. The Libyan President
also sees the current situation as vindication for all of the problematic experiences he encountered in
his long struggle against the Qaddafi regime, This individual believes that Magariaf intends to use his
reputation for integrity, commitment to Islam, and his ability to work with divergent groups to
establish himself as an effective interim President, and eventually the first elected Libyan Head of
State in mid-2013. Magariaf plans to draw on all political, religious, and ethnic groups to form his
cabinet, using his stature to form a representative government under the General National Council.)

i like virtually everything in the two-pager, and I do agree with Tom on the notion of elevating the "national interest"
and security elements of this, both because those have become part of her "brand," and also to help flesh it out in a way
that both gives it the widest reach, and also protects it from attack.
some ways to consider doing that might be to just ensure that the overarching description of it "call out" the national
interest/security reasoning at work - something like "America has the opportunity and the responsibility to lead in the
creation of a network of principled partnerships that will serve our national interest, enhance our security and build the
capacity of people and nations to solve global problems and give everyone more power to reach their potential."
(i inserted "network" of principled partnerships because i think it kind of alludes to both the diversity of the kinds of
partnerships as well as to the influence of technology on building them...not a "must have" but just a thought....in the
same vein, i don't know whether there might be an advantage in alluding to a network of "pragmatic and principled
partnerships" or "practical and principled partnerships" just to ensure it's got that pragmatism aspect of it sharply
inserted).

I like the substance and I might consider if there are ways to communicate, or more strongly affirm, some
elements that would be important for audiences to hear, including that this is an approach of leadership, self-interest,
and values. The values I mean are things like security, stability and building opportunity. Those pieces are in here, but
the notion should be clear that we are not ceding leadership, we are leading by building alliances and partnerships. And
we will always stand for what is right and the right to defend ourselves and our allies, but we are fighting as we always
have for shared values. Make sense? Tom

Dear Burns,
It was good to talk with you again this morning. I am grateful for your willingness to help the Council of Bishops. The
following are dates and times that are available:
Sunday, May 3, 6:00 PM dinner - This is the opening dinner for the Council in which all of the bishops will be present. It
will be at the American University Katzman Arts Center (right on the Nebraska Circle).
Wednesday, May 6, 6:00 PM dinner - Again all of the bishops will be present. This dinner will be at the Bethesda Hyatt,
7400 Wisconsin Avenue.

Another option is on Tuesday, May 6, any time between 2:00 and 4 PM with a group of bishops who are available to
come to the State Department.
Also a group of bishops are available for breakfast or lunch Tuesday through Thursday.
Our first hope is either the Sunday or Wednesday for dinner.

John and Burns, Great talking to you both this evening.
Burns, the United Methodist Bishops from around the world are coming to the Washington area for a weeklong
gathering of bishops. Bishop John is host and arranging their schedule. John can tell you more details ...
it would be wonderful if a time could be found sometime during the week
(Sunday-Friday) for Hillary to meet with the entire group of bishops (around 100 total) or at least the leaders of the
African bishops (perhaps a group of 10 or so).

UNCLASSIFIED U.S. Department of State Case No. F-2014-20439 Doc No. C05758447 Date: 06/30/2015
John notes that the group can be flexible and accomodate Hillary's busy schedule. He suggests that there are a couple
of ideal evening opportunities where all the bishops will be present: this Sunday evening at 6 pm at American
University's Arts Center, or Wednesday at 6 pm at the Hyatt in Bethesda. There also is a Tuesday evening gathering and
reception with just the African bishops -- 7 pm onwards at AP Shaw UMC in SE DC.
If it is not possible for her to go to the bishops, I wonder whether it might be possible for a smaller group (eg, John, the
African bishops and a couple others) to come to the State Department for a meeting in the Secretary's suite or
conference room on the 7th floor. The Secretary obviously has a very busy schedule, but it might well be possible to find
20-30 minutes sometime during the week at the Department. (I haven't yet done so, but I will check the State Dept
website and see what her announced travel schedule is.)
I am happy to help however I can, though it probably is easiest if you coordinate directly. Feel free to copy me at the
above emails if I can be helpful. Here are your cell numbers: Bishop John's is
Burns's is
God's blessings to you both,

Here's a partial list of followup from our last trip and the last week:
What can we do to help protect the Christians in Iraq as requested by Ken Joseph whom we saw in Baghdad?
JoDee Winterhof raised questions about how the PRTs and the language DOD uses about them are problematic for
NGOs like care.
Pls ask one of Holbrooke's people if they ever talked to Wolfgang Danspeckgruber at Princeton about building a railroad
in Aghanistan.
Also Dr. Arthur Keys at International Relief + Development wanted to talk w someone from Holbrooke's team about
development in Af.
I asked the Spec IG for Af Recon, Arnold Fields, to alert us to problems as soon as they can. I'm not sure how to formalize
this or even if it's appropriate. Let's discuss.
What are the "Iran Watchers"?

The Uncommon Trustee
FROM ETHIOPIA TO L.A. WITH $150 IN HIS POCKET, DANIEL YOHANNES BRINGS A QUIET DETERMINATION TO HIS
TRUSTEE ROLE.
By Leah Arroyo
This article was published in Museum, July/August 2008.
Trustee. The word brings to mind a venerable patrician of senior-Nears, "trusted" to guide the interests of an
organization or individual with wisdom and perspective. Someone with old-boy or -girl connections, decades of expertise
and, especially, big bucks—not to mention the ability to pry others away from theirs. Ascot not required, but it couldn't
hurt.
In certain ways, Daniel Yohannes of Denver is not your typical museum trustee. At 17, with $150, he moved from
Ethiopia to Los Angeles as an exchange student without knowing a soul. He immediately got a part-time job as a stock
boy in a clothing store and went on to support himself through high school, Claremont McKenna College and the MBA
program at Pepperdine. He began his banking career as a teller at Security Pacific Bank.
But in other ways, Yohannes is the very portrait of a board member. At 55, the president and CEO of M&R Investments,
a firm specializing in real estate, financial institutions and energy. A former vice chairman of U.S. Bancorp. A few years
ago he started a bank in San Francisco on the side. His board membership extends from the financial (a Fortune 100

company) and educational (U.C. Denver Business School) to community organizations (the chamber of commerce, the
National Jewish Hospital and Research Center, the Boy Scouts Council)—not to mention political service (chairing the
transition team of Gov. Bill Ritter, Democrat of Colorado).
And museums, a priority among the board invitations he has accepted. He served on the Smithsonian Institution's
national board for six years and is now a trustee of the Denver Art Museum (DAM), where he established the Daniel
Yohannes Family African Gallery. "I get a lot of my inspirations intellectually and culturally through art and history,
primarily through museums," he says. "So when I was asked to sit on the [DAM] board, it was just a natural fit for me."
For all his success, though, Yohannes hardly gives the impression of a Type-A personality. Courtly, soft-spoken, with a
melodious accent paying homage to his Ethiopian roots despite his decades in the U.S., he is generous and unhurried
with his time in interviews. On the phone, he asks how you are, what you've been up to lately; told that an interviewer
just bought her first house, he chats for a few moments about how delightful and meaningful that purchase is. In
person, for a conversation at the AAM Annual Meeting in Denver last spring, he walked into a rather dreary
underground room in the convention center, suave in a conservative navy suit and warm in his greetings, politely
oblivious to the tables cluttered with the conference staff's walkie-talkies, office supplies and assortment of snacks. The
photographer got sent to the wrong room and his interviewer had to scurry the length of several football fields to find
her? No problem; he'd reserved plenty of time to talk. "Take your time."
And yet you can at times glimpse the calm determination of a man who gets things done and, moreover, fully expects to.
Vicki Sterling, the Denver Art Museum's assistant director, says that "what was truly unique about working with
[Yohannes] on the African gallery was his ability to bring together people from outside the regular museum donor
community and get them interested in the Denver Art Museum." When you ask him how he did this, who these new
museophiles were, you can almost hear him shrug over the phone. "Friends of mine, people I knew," he says. "They
contributed because I. asked them to." He also shrugs off the question of how he fits all his commitments into his
schedule: "I think as long as there's a desire to get everything done, it gets done." Asked what he does for fun, he has to
think for a moment. "That's a good one.... I walk, I play a little golf, do a little bicycling, sightseeing." He also collects
art, particularly African works, inspired years ago by his travels, though "only as a hobby." Last but not least, he
cherishes spending time with his three children, two of whom live in the area, and was overjoyed to become a
grandfather in May ("She's beautiful," he beams).
You walk away from him with an impression of a quietly dynamic man who has more priorities than most of us but can
somehow bring extraordinary focus to each in turn. He says he was driven from the very beginning. "It was my decision
to come here, not my family's. I've always been a very adventurous person, ever since I was a child, so I made a decision
early on that I wanted to make it on my own. I wanted to go to a place that provided that opportunity for someone like
myself, an immigrant. I could not find any other place but here in the United States that provided all of that
opportunity." Perhaps later generations of his family will be more jaded about the American dream, but Yohannes
speaks of it with unembarrassed directness. "For someone like myself, it's much easier to give to the community that
has given you so much."
Fortunately, he sees museum leadership as part of that obligation.

Dear Cheryl
Following a few discussions with Dick Gephardt - I have pleasure in laying out fairly detailed information about a
conference that is being held in Demark on 3-4 December 2009.
We have made the note reasonably in-depth so hopefully will provide you with sufficient background. The organisers of
the event which are ATP - the largest Danish Pension Fund and the Climate Consortium Denmark are being sponsored
and backed by the Danish government and they were very hopeful that Hillary would be able to be the key note speaker
at the conference for reasons that they have identified in the attached briefing document.
We were hoping to establish whether this event would be of interest for Hillary to appear and if she was available we
would then arrange for the formal invite to be sent out by the Danish Government.
If we can provide any further clarification, please do not hesitate to contact us.
With very Best wishes
Nigel

Sorry to flood your email, but I couldn't resist sending this to you from Ben Smith.
A year later, Hillary wins
A year ago today, the final set of primaries made official the foregone conclusion that Barack Obama had won the
primary, and Hillary Clinton lost it.
There's far too much going on today to dwell on an anniversary, but it does seem worth noting one particular piece of
news in its light: On the central health care policy debate of the Democratic Primary -- which was, to be fair, conducted
within a fairly narrow frame -- Obama appears to have conceded today to a Senate plan likely to more closely resemble
Clinton's.
In a dense, careful letter <http://www.politico.com/static/PPM118_090603_healthcare_ltr.html> to Ted Kennedy nd
Max Baucus, Obama offered his principles <http://www.politico.com/news/stories/0609/23298.html> for a health care
plan and conceded on a central point: He is now open to an individual mandate, which he campaigned against, and
which is now being talked about by Senators of both parties with the buzzword "shared responsibility."
Obama still backs a "hardship waiver" for people unable to afford the mandate -- which is consistent with the core of his
objection to the mandate. But what he cast as a principled difference of approach -- was the problem merely that
people couldn't afford insurance? or something more? -- seems to have been conceded.
Here's the relevant paragraph:
I understand the Committees are moving towards a principle of shared responsibility -- making every American
responsible for having health insurance coverage, and asking that employers share in the cost. I share the goal of ending
lapses and gaps in coverage that make us less healthy and drive up everyone's costs, and I am open to your ideas on
shared responsibility. But I believe if we are going to make people responsible for owning health insurance, we must
make health care affordable. If we do end up with a system where people are responsible for their own insurance, we

need to provide a hardship waiver to exempt Americans who cannot afford it. In addition, while I believe that employers
have a responsibility to support health insurance for their employees, small businesses face a number of special
challenges in affording health benefits and should be exempted.

CONCEPT NOTE FOR WORLD FOOD PRIZE CEREMONY
Thursday, June 11, 2009
This speech is an opportunity to signal the urgency of the problem of global hunger; connect it to an array of global
issues, including economic development, health and education, expanding opportunity for women, and political
stability; and declare the Administration's commitment to tackling hunger at its roots, through effective and efficient
collaboration with an array of partners.
Additionally, your remarks can point to a shift from past approaches by emphasizing the need to support local solutions
and focus on long-term sustainability to help people feed themselves and reduce the need for emergency assistance
down the road.
The speech could be framed as follows:
THE PRIZE AND PRIZE-WINNER
You can begin by announcing the winner of the 2009 World Food Prize, Dr. Gebisa Ejeta. He has a remarkable story:
born in a mud hut in Ethiopia, he got his PhD from Purdue University in plant breeding and genetics and developed
UNCLASSIFIED U.S. Department of State Case No. F-2014-20439 Doc No. C05758705 Date: 06/30/2015
UNCLASSIFIED U.S. Department of State Case No. F-2014-20439 Doc No. C05758705 Date: 06/30/2015
strains of sorghum that are drought-tolerant, high-yield, and resistant to the Striga weed, which devastates crops across
Africa.
Outside the lab, he helped start the Sudanese commercial seed industry; developed systems to produce, certify, and
market hybrid seeds; and educated farmers about the use of fertilizers and soil and water conservation. And he has
trained and inspired the next generation of African agricultural scientists.
A COMPREHENSIVE APPROACH: FROM LAB TO FARM TO MARKET TO TABLE
Dr. Ejeta's work reflects the breadth of this issue and the comprehensive approach needed to address it—one that
connects the labs where new seed technologies are developed.., the fields where small-scale farmers labor to feed their
families and make a living.., the markets where food is bought and sold... and the homes where people get the
nourishment they need to thrive.
In many places, that food chain is broken. One billion people worldwide woke up hungry this morning and will go to
sleep hungry tonight. Chronic hunger threatens health, while making it harder for people to work and students to learn,
which in turn stunts economic development. Last year's food riots demonstrated that when food is scarce, political
stability is threatened.
To date, the world's primary response to hunger has been to send emergency food aid. While this saves lives, it is a
short-term fix, and we need a long-term solution.
The Obama Administration is committed to leading in developing a new global approach. We will support the creation
of sustainable agricultural systems in appropriate regions around the world, to increase agricultural productivity, create
jobs, strengthen economies, and protect natural resources.
We will do this not by imposing one-size-fits-all solutions, but by assisting countries in carrying out individual strategies
that meet their needs—for example, through the Comprehensive Africa Agriculture Development Plan. To facilitate
coordination and share best practices, we will seek to convene donor governments, multilateral institutions, NG0s,
private companies, foundations, universities, and individuals.
THE ANCHORS OF OUR APPROACH
We've identified seven anchors that secure sustainable agriculture systems. These will guide our approach.
• Increase agricultural productivity by expanding access to quality seeds, fertilizer, irrigation, the credit to purchase
them, and the training to use them.
• Stimulate the post-harvest sector by improving the storage and processing of food and improving transportation to
connect small farmers to markets.
• Maintain natural resources so the land can be farmed well into the future and we can make the right adaptations
for the changing environment.

UNCLASSIFIED U.S. Department of State Case No. F-2014-20439 Doc No. C05758705 Date: 06/30/2015
Expand knowledge and training by support R&D and developing the next generation of agriculture scientists.
Increase trade so small-scale farmers in developing countries can sell their crops far and wide.
• Support policy reform and good governance, because sustainable agriculture flourishes in a,clear and predictable
policy and regulatory environment.
• Support women and families in agriculture. Seventy percent of the world's farmers are women, but most of the
programs that offer credit and training to farmers target men. This must change for agriculture to thrive. And children
must have nutrition to contribute to their communities' future.
A PREVIEW OF WHAT'S TO COME
In the coming weeks, President Obama, Secretary Vilsack and I will be reaching out to share our approach to global
coordination and agriculture in greater detail. We will seek the input, wisdom and guidance of those who have been
working so long in this arena—from the Congress to NGOs to academics to foundations to the private sector. The
President's conversations at the G-8 meeting in Italy in two weeks will address our approach, as well as my trip to Africa
in August.
Addressing hunger and food is essential to achieving economic recovery, stabilizing societies, and expanding opportunity
for hundreds of millions of people worldwide. This is why supporting sustainable agriculture worldwide will be a central
element of foreign policy in the Obama Administration.
CONCLUSION

Most interesting observation of the day, from
"A statistical analysis of the data issued by the ministry of interior suggests a perfect linear relationship between votes
received by Ahmadinejad and Mousavi with an r-squared value of 0.9995, a near impossibility in nature.This suggests
that the ballots were never counted or were abandoned after it was clear Ahmadinejad was going to lose. Statistically, it
is impossible to maintain such a perfect linear relationship consistently through all stages of vote counting. We would
expect variation as the votes were coming in, due to differences expected between the cites and the country side and
hetereogeneity amoung ethnic groups.This to me is the most concrete evidence I have seen"

Spanish FM Moratinos has requested to speak with you today. Tom can give u verbal download but below are basic
points. Let me know if u want us to set up call
Points:
- We condemn the effort to remove Zelaya from office.
- We are working within the OAS and with our regional partners to resolve this situation quickly and in a manner that
restores democratic order.
- We appreciate the role Spain played in winning quick EU condemnation of the coup attempt.
- Our work is not done. Rebuilding trust among competing political institutions and reducing polarization within
Honduras will take a lot of work. We hope Spain will work with us and the OAS to ensure a restoration of democratic
order that will allow Honduras to carry through with it electoral timetable (presidential vote scheduled for November)
Note from tom:
Aside from the statements issued by the President and the Secretary, we have been working in the OAS Permanent
Council fashioning a consensus resolution mapping out a path forward, reaching out to regional partners ( I have spoken
twice with Salvadoran President Funes, and our Ambassadors have been working with other Central American leaders),
and working within Honduras to limit the damage to Honduras institutions.

TEGUCIGALPA, June 30 (Reuters) - An interim government set up after a military coup in Honduras said it will send a
delegation of politicians, business leaders and lawyers to Washington on Wednesday for talks on the crisis.
Roberto Micheletti, sworn in as caretaker president after leftist President Manuel Zelaya was toppled by the army on
Sunday, announced the mission after Zelaya traveled to New York and Washington to address the United Nations and
Organization of American States.

Saddam's rule 'better' for gay Iraqis
Investigating reports of the murder and torture of gay men in Iraq, Ashley Byrne found that some gays found Saddam
Hussein's dictatorship preferable to the threat of violence they face today. Some readers will find parts of his report
disturbing.
There has been so much news of death and destruction from Iraq that the position of sexual minorities is rarely touched
on in the mainstream media.
But stories of torture and murder of gay Iraqis, particularly men, have been emerging in the gay press for several years.
Investigating these stories for a BBC Radio 5 Live documentary, Gay Life After Saddam, I've heard a range of views about
the deteriorating conditions for Lesbian, Gay, Bisexual and Transgender (LGBT) people.
Some say the violence has intensified in the past few months. Others say killings run into the hundreds and have been
going on since 2003.

What is clear, and confirmed by separate evidence from various human rights groups, is that some gay men have been
subjected to appalling violent abuse.
One young Iraqi, Amil (not his real name) recalled the death of a friend: "They found out he was gay and they killed him
and they chopped him like a lamb, it was awful."
Another man (who wished to remain anonymous) revealed to Scott Long from the New York-based Human Rights
Watch, how his partner was kidnapped and killed.
"It was late one night when four armed men came to take my boyfriend from his parents' house.
" They found out he was gay and they killed him and they chopped him like a Iamb"
Amil, a gay Iraqi
"They were masked and dressed in black.
"We found his body the next day dumped in the garbage, his throat cut out, his genitals cut off."
Of all the shocking testimony we heard, a form of torture involving glue has to be the most awful revelation to emerge
from our investigations.
Human Rights Watch researcher Rasha Moumneh told us: "We've heard stories of gay-specific torture where men have
glue in their anuses and they force-feed them laxatives."
Gay men inside Iraq have been able to seek sanctuary in safe houses, thanks to the UK-based Iraqi Lesbian Gay Bisexual
and Transgender (LGBT) group, which manages them from London.
The documentary team were granted exclusive access to one of the homes on the outskirts of Baghdad, where we found
a 31-year-old transsexual man called Qasim (not his real name).
Qasim said: "I'm scared all the time. I often think people are going to come in the night and take me because I am
particularly known as gay."
All the LGBT Iraqis interviewed for Gay Life After Saddam maintained that life was easier for them when Saddam Hussein
was in power, from 1979 to 2003.
Some spoke fondly of an underground gay culture that flourished before the war in Baghdad.
But it was unclear exactly what Saddam's view on homosexuality was, and there has been some evidence to suggest that
the former dictator was acting to clamp down on sexual minorities in the latter years of his reign.
So who is to blame for the violence against LGBT people in Iraq?
Some blame militia, while other accuse religious leaders of stoking up hatred of homosexuals, though some clerics have
also recently condemned the attacks on gays.
The Iraqi government and police also deny that there have been any state-sanctioned killings or torture of homosexuals
in Iraq.
What is clear however is that gay people in Iraq have not been crushed.
He may be holed up in a safe house but Qasim is hopeful: "I find the Iraqi prime minister quite good.

"I hope he can talk with religious leaders, change the constitution and punish and imprison the murderers."
Meanwhile the refugee who runs the safe houses from London, Ali HiIli, lives in constant fear of his life after being sent
two fatwas, or Islamic religious rulings.
But he has insisted he will not give up trying to help gay people in Iraq.
"If I think too much that someone is going to get me and kill me then I know I'd stop what I'm doing.
"I have to continue because I really believe in the work that I am doing."
Gay Life After Saddam was broadcast on Radio 5 Live, Sunday 5 July.

My guess is that he is calling about Honduras. He, like many other leaders with an interest in Central America, is worried
that Honduras is slipping towards confrontation and violence. He probably does not think Insulza is up to the task. S
should be aware that Arias is prepared to offer his services. I spoke with the Costa Rican FonMin, who said the de facto
government has reached out to Arias, and that the Costa Ricans will be looking for a way to make the offer to Zelaya.
Uribe knows Zelaya and has some influence. Uribe might want to talk with Arias and offer to help move Zelaya in the
right direction. (Although Uribe and Zelaya come from different ends of the political spectrum, they are both ranchers
and love horses, and this has created some comradeship.)

Dear Secretary Clinton,
Your assistant, Lona Valmoro, and I have been exchanging emails on trying to find a time to meet in Washington on July
30. I am hopeful something can be worked out. In the meantime, I wanted to take you up on your offer below and
provide you with a few thoughts on China prior to the upcoming SED on July 27-28. I send you this note from Beijing
(midway through a four-day visit) via Blackberry -- so apologies for any typos.
1. Mounting signs of social instability have intensified China's growth imperatives. Beijing insiders are very concerned
about the Xinjiang uprising; Hu Jintao's pre-G-8 exit validates those concerns. Coming on the heels of last year's
problems in Tibet, social instability can no longer be dismissed as an isolated occurrence. In both cases, my sources claim
growth shortfalls have exacerbated ethnic disturbances. China's recent fiscal stimulus -- especially infrastructure
initiatives in the West -- attempts to address this. Growth has long been modern China's antidote to the risks of social
instability.
2. A massive external demand shock dilutes the growth antidote that China needs to contain social instability. In fact,
the global recession adds a new risk factor to China's social instability equation. The government has confirmed reports
of over 20 million layoffs of migrant workers in export-intensive Guangdong Province -- a direct outgrowth of the
collapse of Chinese exports over the past year (from growth of +25% in mid-2008 to a contraction of -25% in May 2009).
Driven by a record capitulation of the American consumer -- real US consumption down by -1.8% over the past four
quarters (a 58-year record plunge) -- China's biggest source of end-market export demand has been hit with an
extraordinary shock. To the extent there is more to come on this count -- and that remains my best guess, although with
a less dramatic US consumption adjustment than we saw over the past year -- external demand pressures will continue
to undermine China's growth imperatives and feed heightened concerns over social instability.
3. China's stimulus package is a "quick fix" that can only exacerbate its already worrisome structural imbalances. The
focus of the stimulus is on its two most unbalanced sectors -- fixed investment and exports, which collectively account
for about 80% of Chinese GDP. Fully 72% of the RMB4 trillion fiscal initiative announced last November goes to
infrastructure. And there are aggressive incentives directed at exporters (i.e., tax rebates, "buy China" procurement
incentives, SME credit support, etc.). Moreover, there has been a huge push of State-directed bank lending -- the full-
year 2009 lending target was hit in mid-April! This latter initiative underscores the risks of deteriorating loan quality and
associated banking problems down the road. Meanwhile, despite public claims to the contrary, very little has been done
to stimulate the one sector in China that needs it the most -- internal private consumption. Social safety net efforts are
still puny -- the recent healthcare plan translates into US$30 per person for three years and the National Social Security
Fund only has enough assets to provide about $90 of lifetime social security benefits per worker! This forces fear-driven
-- or precautionary -- saving that, in turn, inhibits the consumer-led impetus a Chinese rebalancing urgently needs.

UNCLASSIFIED U.S. Department of State Case No. F-2014-20439 Doc No. C05758986 Date: 06/30/2015
4. All this points to an asymmetrical global rebalancing -- a very worrisome prognosis for a post-crisis world. Despite all if
our problems, the US is actually tempering its greatest macro imbalance -- excess consumption. At the same time, China
is unfortunately upping the ante on its two most unbalanced sectors -- investment and exports. Sadly, this could set up a
still unbalanced global economy for another serious accident in the not-so-distant future.
Sorry to have rambled so much. There is a good deal more to each of the points above -- but wanted to give you the
highlights ahead of the SED. Good luck with that -- and with all else that seems to be going on around the world. Hope to
see you on the 30th.

Dear Secretary Clinton,
Although I regretfully missed seeing you on your swing through Beijing earlier this year, I will be back in Washington on
July 30. Would love the opportunity to meet with you briefly and give you up update on my thoughts/ insights into China
and the rest of the region. The story is not quite as neat as it appears on the surface. Despite all the hype, this region
remains an export machine that should struggle in the aftermath of the crisis -- with important implications for many of
the global economic issues you are facing. I have had extensive meetings throughout the region over the past few
months and would welcome the opportunity to provide you with a first hand assessment.
One other note: I will be publishing a book in Sept! Oct, "The Next Asia", which digs beneath the surface of many of the
macro issues the region faces. It is generally constructive on the Asian outlook but lays out a number of critical

Moscow preparations are in reasonable shape. Afghan lethal transit agreement is done, and will be signed on Monday.
There's also a broader statement on cooperation on counter-narcotics and reconstruction in Afghanistan. (Bakiyev has
now signed the Manas agreement, which is a further boost on Afghanistan.)
The Presidents will announce the bilateral
commission, and your trip to Russia in the fall to launch the process with Lavrov. All in all a good measured realistic
step in our effort to rebuild relations --
I'll be in Rome just for the first, "foreign policy" portion of the G8. We're working on a Leaders' statement that is likely
to look a lot like last week's G8 Foreign Ministers statement on most issues, with an update on North Korea, and
essentially the same, firm line on Iran.
I leave Rome on July 9 with an interagency delegation for stops in Kazakhstan, Uzbekistan, Turkmenistan and Kyrgyzstan,
back in DC on July 14.
Hope you had a good Fourth, and all the best,

Whenever you do something big on TV we all hear from lots of folks saying you did great. But this time is noticeably
different. First, people across the spectrum - DC insiders, reporters, staff, ex-staff, friends of friends, WH folks, etc -
were blown away. Second, people were REALLY moved by the last segment, three people even told me they teared up.
I'm guessing and hoping you hear this directly from random folks in the coming days.
And I think because it's been a lousy couple of weeks for the Admin, with mixed messages and bad news, coupled with
many people seeing you for the first time for an extended period talking about the job and your relationship with the
President, and that combo was probably the most powerful reminder since your speech in Denver that you're in a class
all your own (including the President who became enmeshed in the Gates incident)
That you didn't wait for the envoy question was key, you turned it into a strength. What you said about the President
and how you said it, one can't help but think how much of a team player you are and how remarkably you've adapted to
the role.
You were definitely on your game. You either threw a perfect game - or at least a no hitter. So this couldn't have gone
better, achieved everything we needed to times 10, and comes on the heels of a great 10 days.
Will be interesting to see the storyline that emanates from this. Because there was no substantive news, it'll be a focus
on style - especially saving Biden.

Subject: Secretary Clinton Must Focus on Cause of Congo Conflict
Secretary of State Hillary Clinton should focus on the fuel which drives the violence in Congo, the conflict minerals
extracted from the eastern war zone and widely used by our consumer electronics industry. "Clinton's visit to Goma
tomorrow provides the opportunity for the United States to deepen its overdue engagement in search of a solution for
the world's deadliest war," Enough Project co-founder John Prendergast said today.
"Tantalum helps cool cell phones and laptops. Tungsten enables the vibration function in a cell phone. Tin is a solder for
most circuit boards in nearly every electronic product. And gold is used to encase wiring. Until the trade in minerals
becomes legal and transparent, there will be no peace in Congo," Prendergast said.
Clinton earlier highlighted the role of conflict minerals in what she called "the unspeakable violence against women and
girls in eastern Congo."
"It is the worst example of man's inhumanity to women. And women are being used in conflicts. Now, what are the
conflicts about? Well, yes, there are tribal and other reasons why the conflicts are going on, but get below the surface.
It's because there are mines in eastern Congo that produce the minerals that go into our cell phones and our other
electronics. There is a lot of money being made by a lot of people, but it sure isn't helping the people of the DRC,"
Clinton said in an interview in Nairobi.
The majority of sexual violence cases reported in North Kivu since January have been attributed to government soldiers
according to the Congo Advocacy Coalition, a group of 88 humanitarian and human rights organizations, including
Enough Project. Early last month the Congolese Government announced a policy of "zero tolerance" for abuses
committed by army soldiers and said commanders who permit their troops to commit such crimes will be held
responsible but to date, only a handful of officers have been arrested.

"The increase in rape in an area where already so many women and girls have been victims is deplorable," said Olivia
Caeymaex of Enough. "Ending impunity for rape and other serious crimes needs to be at the heart of any strategy to
combat sexual violence. Secretary Clinton should ensure US diplomatic and financial assets are focused on bringing to
justice those who are most responsible."

hindering development in southern Sudan. Congress already took action in 2006 to create significant exceptions for the
south and other marginalized areas of Sudan for development purposes.
We should not roll back the sanctions. We need assurances from Secretary Clinton that the Obama Administration will
support keeping the sanctions in place until the Sudan government fulfills its obligations on the Comprehensive Peace
Agreement and the peace process in Darfur. You can text the message or email here.

A woman carrying her child runs for safety from the burning compound of presidential candidate Jean-Pierre Bemba's
bodyguards in Congo's capital, Kinshasa, in July 2006. Congo's largely successful elections in 2006 have not proven to be
a panacea to Congo's ills; 45,000 people die each month, mostly from the crippling effects of widespread conflict in the
Congo's eastern provinces.

Cheryl —
Well, I finally made it. Quite a start to be able to ride in with the President in AF1 and then roll into meetings with
Calderon and the leadership of the Mexican government. I will spend this week in Mexico. I will be back next week to
pack out, but will also follow up on a number of other issues while I am there.
I wanted to ask if you thought it might be possible to get a bit of time with the Secretary. There are two requests going
through the system. One is for a formal swearing in. I understand that she has one swearing in at 4:00 on Monday in
the Ben Franklin room, so one option would be if she could do the same for me in the Treaty Room at 4:30. I know this
is short notice — this has been one of those cases where planning has alluded us.
The second request is for a meeting with the Secretary. I would very much appreciate the chance to go over priorities
moving forward, as well as provide a few initial observations.

Preaching reform, Clinton wins African hearts
By DONNA BRYSON (AP) –1 hour ago
JOHANNESBURG — In Liberia, Hillary Clinton brought out the crowds despite torrential rain. In Congo, she came away
deeply shaken from a meeting with rape victims. Kenya's prime minister said Africa didn't need lectures from the West
about democracy, but Africa got one anyway.
At home, the U.S. secretary of state's visit may have been overshadowed by the aftermath of her husband's mission to
North Korea to bring home two imprisoned U.S. journalists. But on her seven-nation Africa tour, ending Friday with a
stopover in the West African island republic of Cape Verde, she made one splash after another.
Coupled with Barack Obama's visit last month, the two trips to Africa were the earliest into an administration by any
secretary of state or president, underlining Washington's pledges to pay more attention to the continent.
In the U.S., the headline-making moment of the trip was her testy response to a question about Bill Clinton. But in
Africa, it quickly became a footnote. What people wanted to hear was support for democracy, clean government and
ending its many civil wars.
Clinton's ambitious itinerary resembled those of China's foreign minister, who makes extensive annual tours of his
country's allies on the continent. But where China tends to sidestep the issues of corruption democracy, Clinton
confronted them head-on.
Kenyan Prime Minister Raila Odinga, speaking hours before Clinton arrived, said Africa did not need to be lectured about
democracy. After they met, she did just that. "The absence of strong and effective democratic institutions has permitted

UNCLASSIFIED U.S. Department of State Case No. F-2014-20439 Doc No. C05759145 Date: 06/30/2015
ongoing corruption, impunity, politically motivated violence and a lack of respect for a rule of law," Clinton said. "These
conditions ... are continuing to hold Kenya back."
Odinga switched to a more conciliatory tone, saying African countries could learn from Clinton's example when she
conceded defeat to Obama during the U.S. presidential primaries.
"That is a lesson Africa needs to learn seriously," he said. "In Africa, in many countries, elections are never won, they are
only rigged. The losers never accept that they lost. If we do this, we will be able to develop democracy truly in the
African continent."
In Angola, she told Foreign Minister Assuncao Afonso dos Anjos that his country needed to write a new constitution,
prosecute human rights crimes and hold a proper presidential election.
"So, Mr. Minister, we have our work cut out for us," she said.
And in Nigeria, Africa's biggest oil producer, she said "the disconnect between Nigeria's wealth and its poverty is a
failure of governance at the federal, state and local level."
To Africa's reformers, often an embattled minority, these were heartening words.
Emma Ezeazu, who campaigns for free and fair elections in his native Nigeria, said Clinton's visit showed that U.S.
officials "are becoming more pro-active in their relationship with Nigeria, in particular on the subject of governance and
democracy. They are paying more attention."
Tiseke Kasambala, a Johannesburg-based researcher for Human Rights Watch, commended her grasp of human rights
abuses in Africa — not just the headline-makers, like Zimbabwe and Congo, but the lesser publicized offenders such as
Angola.
In Goma, a Congo town in a region ravaged by gang rapes amid continuing fighting between army and rebels, Clinton
announced $17 million in American aid to help the victims.
She toured a squalid camp of 18,000 refugees and heard one of them tell her, "We really want to return home, that's
why we are asking America to help stop the fighting."
"That's why I'm here," Clinton replied. "I want you to be able to go home."
In Cape Town, South Africa, big, joyous crowds turned out for her at a housing project. In Liberia, founded in 1847 by
freed American slaves, rain-drenched crowds waved U.S. and Liberian flags at Clinton's motorcade.
The crowds in Nigeria and Angola were fewer, but community and religious leaders seemed excited just to be with
Clinton and be heard by her.
Nancy Kachingwe, a Malawian with the development group ActionAid, applauded Clinton's "very strong emphasis
around women's rights."
Some of former President George W. Bush's Africa initiatives, particularly on AIDS, have been widely praised in Africa.
But there were also sharp differences over world trade, global warming, and over the Bush administration's anti-
terrorism strategy.
Washington wants to buy Africa's oil and gain access to its markets, and fears instability in places like Somalia could fuel
anti-U.S. terrorism. Clinton won points by stressing that as the U.S. pursues its interests, it sees the virtue of "working
with and listening to our friends and allies, and creating not a multipolar world, but a multi-partner world."

Kachingwe said what matters now is the follow-up.
"There will be a positive impact" from Clinton's trip, she said. "But somewhere along the way, we do need to see ...
what's going to come to keep the momentum going."

Thanks, Hillary. I don't know about details of Obama's plan, but you looked terrific at the speech. (Lincoln, in 1864, on
Obama's plan: "The difficulty is not in stating the principle, it is in applying it.") Too bad Rep. Wilson didn't wear a red
pantsuit.
Max continues to rocket--up to #8 overall this am, #1 in every nonfiction category except cookbooks. And last night in an
special election Jackie was elected Advisory Neighborhood Commissioner in DC. It was a hard fought race, in fact, and
her opponent ran a negative campaign against her on email with the slogan: "She's Not Jackie."
Here's the draft of the article Max has written on the bad Joe Wilson (membership in racist organization) and that will be
published today. This should do it.
Let's speak when you have time.
Rep. Joe Wilson's Rebel Yell
Inside the racist klavern that Joe Wilson joined By Max Blumenthal
Since Republican Rep. Joe Wilson of South Carolina bellowed at President Barack Obama, "You lie!" during the
president's nationally televised speech on healthcare, the fourth term backbencher has emerged as a hero among the
conservative grassroots. One of the most enthusiastic endorsements of Wilson's histrionics came from the Sons of
Confederate Veterans (SCV), a group that Wilson has <a href=http://crooksandliars.com/david-neiwert/obama-heckler-
joe-wilson-member-neo>belonged to</a> for several years.
"Mr. Wilson, never apologize for allowing your love of truth to overrun your desire to be polite," the SCV Tea Party <a
href=http://scvteaparty.com/?p=165>declared</a> on its website. "It is the liar who must apologize, not the one who
identifies the liar!"
Who are the SCV? A once-proud organization of Confederate history buffs and re-enactors who spent their
organization's money to restore Civil War-era battlefields and Confederate cemeteries, by 2006 the SCV was
substantially <a href=http://www.spIcenter.org/intel/intelreport/article.jsp?pid=1027 >taken over</a> by an organized
cadre of white supremacist radicals (read <a href=http://www.spIcenter.org/intel/intelreport/article.jsp?pid=154
>here</a> for more background) who sought to turn the nation's oldest Southern historical society into what the
veteran white supremacist activist Kirk Lyons called "a modern, 21st century Christian war machine capable of uniting
the Confederate community and leading it to ultimate victory." When the racist junta had seized much of the SCV's
leadership positions, the Southern Poverty Law Center released an <a

UNCLASSIFIED U.S. Department of State Case No. F-2014-20439 Doc No. C05759668 Date: 06/30/2015
href=http://www.spIcenter.org/intel/intelreport/article.jsp?sid=90 >extensive list</a> of SCV officials who belonged to
"hate groups."
Lyons, a key leader of the white supremacists who took over the SCV, had <a
href=http://www.thenation.com/doc/20050829/blumenthal/single >harbored dreams</a> of creating a seemingly
benign front group for a more sophisticated version of the Ku Klux Klan. "I have great respect for the Klan historically,
but, sadly the Klan today is ineffective and sometimes even destructive," Lyons told a German neo-Nazi magazine in
1992. "It would be good if the Klan followed the advice of former Klansman Robert Miles: 'Become invisible. Hang the
robes and hoods in the cupboard and become an underground org anization." With the SCV, Lyons discovered he didn't
have to go underground after all.
Once Lyons helped install his close friend, Ron Wilson, as president of the SCV, the organization's political newsletter, <a
href=http://fpacscv.org/southernmercury/ >The Southern Mercury</a> (where Wilson served as senior editor),
transformed into a propaganda mill for crude white supremacist cant. Mailed to all dues-paying members of the SCV —
presumably including Rep. Joe Wilson — until it went defunct in 2008, the Mercury has published articles describing
blacks as genetically inferior to whites, calling African-Americans as "a childlike people," and warned that if Obama runs
for re-election, race riots of an "exceedingly violent nature" would immediately ensure, leaving "entire sections of some
of our cities in ruins."
Here are a few highlights from the Southern Mercury:
"After the turn of the 20th century, the white Southerners had disfranchised and segregated the blacks, in perhaps the
mildest reaction possible at=2 Othat time to the blacks' transgressions. The blacks — then a childlike people — had been
selling their votes to the Democrats en masse for $.25 apiece in national elections."
—"Where We Stand Now, And How We Got Here," by Frank Conner, Southern Mercury, September/October 2003
"Previously, anthropologists had routinely recorded the notable differences in IQ among the races; but at Columbia, a
liberal cultural anthropologist named Franz Boas...decreed that there were no differences in IQ among the races, and the
only biological differences between the blacks and whites were of superficial nature... Meanwhile, the liberals in the
media heaped special praise upon black athletes, musicians, singers, and writers — and treated them as typical of the
black race. The liberals were creating a false image of the blacks in America as a highly competent people who were
being held back by the prejudiced white Southerners."
--Conner, September/October 2003
"It is very clear to me that if Barack Obama should be elected President, he would be extremely anti-white and would
demand reparations for slavery and press hard for affirmative action to the degree that it would hurt young whites who
were seeking jobs or admission to College and Graduate Schools."
—
"Americans Face The Worst Presidential Candidates In History," by Robert Slimp, Southern Mercury, May/June 2008
"I believe that [Obama's] rhetoric and anti-white legislative proposals would stir up racial riots. If he were running for re-
election, these riots would turn into an exceedingly violent nature that would seriously damage race relations in
America, and leave entire sections of some of our cities in ruins."
--Slimp, May/June 2008
Rep. Joe Wilson could have resigned from the SCV as soon as the organization's takeover by open white supremacists
began. But he didn't. Or he could have withdrawn his membership when the SCV's flagship journal turned into a racist
rag. But he didn't. Instead, while serving as a state senator, Wilson led an SCV-inspired campaign in 2000 to keep the
Confederate flag flying above South Carolina's state capitol. "The Southern heritage, the Confederate heritage, is very
honorable," Wilson <a href=http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/americas/503579.stm>proclaimed</a> at the time, responding
to critics of the Confederate flag.

friendly way.
I sought an appointment with the Prime Minister to brief her on our problems,
at the advice of the US ambassador in Dhaka. But it is now over six weeks,
her office never responded.
Almost every important person in Bangladesh congratulated me for receiving
the Presidential Medal of Freedom. Prime Minister and her party said not
a word about it.
So you can see the depth of the problem.
I thought I should keep you briefed and let you figure out what to be done.
Thanks for your help. Give my regards to H.

I talked to Yunus. She is making any progess very difficult. The health project he discussed with yoiu can't get OKs from
govt for Nursing school, univ health center, corporate partnerships, etc. If she hears it's Grameen, she stands in way of
licenses, etc, even tho it benefits the country.
He was hoping there might be some way to assure her that he has NO intention of getting into politics in any way and
that she can use him effectively to make the country a model in ways that Grameen can do that. There is some deep
personal antagonism that he can't fathom. Very sad development.

Dear Melanne:
I am drawing your attenrtion to the following report in the leading daily
newspaper in Bangladesh. All other papers carried the same news.
This is a report on the Prime Minister Hasina's speech on the floor
of the parliament. High-lighted section of the report refers to me
without naming name but giving her usual description of me.
See if you can find a way to clear her mind of all the terrifying thoughts
she has about me. I invite you to be a peace-maker! Otherwise it will become
explosive for nothing. PM Hasina is coming to NY for General Assembly
meeting, and will have a meeting with Sec H during her visit.
See you soon.

Prime Mnister Hasina Warns
The Daily Star, Dhaka, September 17, 2009
Prime Minister Sheikh Hasina yesterday alerted the countrymen to the
ongoing conspiracy of 'special quarter' and 'undemocratic forces' who are
still plotting to wipe out democracy and grab the seat in power after
being failed to capture it.
The prime minister, however, urged the Leader of the Opposition and BNP
Chairperson Khaleda Zia and her allies to return to parliament for raising
their voices.
Recalling her experience as the opposition leader, Hasina said, "We used
to walk out from parliament sessions, boycott it but we used to return to

UNCLASSIFIED U.S. Department of State Case No. F-2014-20439 Doc No. C05759784 Date: 06/30/2015
the House again."
Meanwhile, the parliament session was adjourned till 4:00pm on October 4.
Sheikh Hasina, also ruling Awami League (AL) president, urged people to keep vigil against recurrence of incidents like
BDR mutiny to reverse the democratic strides. She also urged the people not to be misguided by any 'false campaign.'
"While running the government and doing development works, we find continued obstacles in every step from the
'special quarter', benefited by undemocratic government, who earlier had captured power through undemocratic
means, So, I urge the countrymen to be cautious so that the democratic trend continues," she told the parliament.
The prime minister was speaking at a discussion titled 'democracy and political tolerance' on the occasion of the
International Day of Democracy.
Following an hour long discussion, the House passed a resolution by which Bangladesh will also observe the
International Day of Democracy through holding a discussion in the parliament every year.
Inter-Parliamentary Union decided to observe September 15 of every year as International Day of Democracy in the
context of a resolution adopted by the United Nations in 2007.
The International Day of Democracy was first observed in 2008 but Bangladesh could not observe the day as unelected
caretaker government ruled the country during that time.
Referring to the sugar price, Sheikh Hasina told the House that a big conspiracy is going on regarding sugar price. Price of
sugar is being raised though stock of sugar is available. "We are investigating the matter and action will be taken against
those who are responsible for it,"
said the Leader of the House.

UNCLASSIFIED U.S. Department of State Case No. F-2014-20439 Doc No. C05759784 Date: 06/30/2015
On plotting of the conspiracy, Sheikh Hasina said people who wanted to sit in power without election are still hatching
conspiracy against her government.
Pointing out the two years of the past caretaker government, Hasina said, "Various formulas were floated during that
time by those who would lose security money if contest any election."
She also disclosed in parliament that many proposals were given to her
(Hasina) during that time including offering her the status of a prime minister without participating,in elections, which
she rejected.
Without mentioning any name, the prime minister said, those who wanted to capture power by creating new political
parties are still continuing their activities to capture power.
"Those persons who had failed to float a new political party, exploit
people, get huge interest from poor people and remain in disguise of good
men wearing good dresses are still busy hatching a conspiracy against the
government," said Hasina, who was sent to a makeshift jail during the
anti-graft drive of the past caretaker government.
She, however, hailed the caretaker regime for holding a free and fair election, which she claimed as the best election
since 1973.
The AL Chief Hasina told lawmakers that the country has been pushed back economically, socially and culturally by
applying the undemocratic and military rule while only a special quarter became rich but the majority people remained
ignored.

UNCLASSIFIED U.S. Department of State Case No. F-2014-20439 Doc No. C05759784 Date: 06/30/2015
The premier vowed that her government is committed to materialise all its election pledges to fulfil the desire of the
people.
Hasina said her party believes in the definition of democracy given by Abraham Lincoln who said Democracy means--by
the People, of the People, for the People.
"But this democracy has been absent in the country since 1975 when the military ruler grabbed power throwing an
elected government," she said.
AL leaders Sheikh Fazlul Karim Selim, Suranjit Sengupta, Abdul Latif Siddiqui, Advocate Fazle Rabbi Mia, Abdul Matin
Khasru, Bangladesh Workers' Party President Rashed Khan Menon, among others, took part in the discussion.

Hi Burns,
I received the email below from Lyn Lusi, a highly trained and experienced program administrator with HEAL Africa
(Congo). I tried to line her up to be a speaker at the Global Summit that Hillary attended, but we were unable to book
her due to scheduling issues. She's not some random, run-of-the-mill aid worker; she's really, really special, having set
up the fistula hospital and teaching hospital in Goma with her husband, Dr. Jo Lusi. Lyn sent me this email and requested
I "do what I can" to encourage Hillary to empower the indigenous physicians and trained personnel in this hospital
rather than bring in outside partners to start something new.
Blessings to you,

Conversation: Suggested letter for follow up to Mrs Clinton's visit to HEAL Africa
Subject: Suggested letter for follow up to Mrs Clinton's visit to HEAL Africa
This is Lyn Lusi writing to you from HEAL Africa in Goma and your address comes from the business card you left me
when you visited us. You may have heard that Secretary of State Mrs Clinton and Ambassador Ms Verveer came to
HEAL Africa on Tuesday 11th August. The visit went very well, and the organisation was impeccable, so she could
achieve her objectives. While in our Conference Centre, she announced a package of aid to Congo to fight Gender Based
Violence.
First she congratulated HEAL Africa on the excellent work we are doing; then she announced a deal between the US and
the Norwegian Government to build a state of the art fistula and teaching hospital in Goma.
She must have been aware of the shock and discouragement of all our staff. In effect she was saying:
"Your excellent work is not really excellent at all, and we will work with the Norwegians to replace you in North Kivu."
I seriously believe she was not properly briefed, because of some remarks she made as she was leaving.
This is now a request to you, and if possible, other members of the your organisation, if you would be so kind as to
contact them. Nothing is set in stone, and politicians respond to pressure from their friends and constituencies. We
believe that wise use of funds means building capacity among local organisations that have already proved that they can
do the work, and sustain their efforts, rather than starting something new.
I am attaching below a letter like the one we have written to Mrs Clinton and a similar one to Ambassador Verveer. If
you think it is appropriate, we are requesting you to write a similar letter to both of them. We are hoping that local
Congolese organisations will not be excluded from these resources to build local capacity on the foundations of what is
being done already.
With kind regards.

SUGGESTED LETTER
Secretary of State Mrs Hillary Clinton
U.S. Department of State
2201 C Street NW
Washington, DC 20520
Goma, 11th August 2009
Dear Mrs Clinton,
I/ We followed with interest reports of your visit to Goma on 11th August 2009, where you convened a meeting of
Congolese actors in the fight against Gender Based Violence at HEAL Africa training center. The commitment of the
people of the United States to working alongside Congolese associations for peace and human rights is heartening, after
16 years of endless war.
We congratulate you for this pioneering visit which gave a voice to Congolese community based organizations, who are
often overpowered by international actors. We sincerely hope that the US government and USAID will take the next step
in working alongside community based organizations in Eastern Congo.

UNCLASSIFIED U.S. Department of State Case No. F-2014-20439 Doc No. C05760036 Date: 06/30/2015
After studying the announcement of the package of assistance that is being prepared to contribute to fighting Gender
Based Violence in the east of Congo, we are mystified to hear that the United States and the Norwegian government
have decided to build for North Kivu a centre of excellence for training doctors in fistula repair and care of mothers.
According to good development principles, outside assistance builds on what is already in place and functioning well,
developing proven capacity and giving local actors the additional tools they need to do a better job.
As friends and supporters of HEAL Africa for many years, we know that this hospital has pioneered fistula repair in North
Kivu and Maniema provinces since 2002, when no one else was interested in caring for women with fistula. They have
four experienced surgeons trained in Addis Ababa fistula hospital, and have performed over 1600 fistula surgeries. HEAL
Africa has a wide network of community based workers to identify and support patients coming and returning. HEAL
Africa's surgical teams perform outreach surgery in North Kivu and Maniema provinces in local general hospitals, linked
at the same time with in-service training of local staff, and referring only the most complicated cases to Goma. These
services are recognized by reputable agencies since the United States through IRC, through UNICEF and through
Engenderhealth, has invested in HEAL Africa staff, equipment and infrastructure over the past five year. The Spanish
Embassy has supported HEAL Africa's prevention of fistula initiatives over the past four years, through their wide-
reaching Safe Motherhood program, working through local associations of mothers-to-be for maternity insurance and
access to safe deliveries.
HEAL Africa has a clearly defined place within the government medical system of North Kivu where they are recognized
as the tertiary referral hospital of the province. Thus they are a recognized clinical training centre of the Medical Faculty
of the University of Goma, offering the first two years of accredited clinical specialization in Pediatrics, Obstetrics and
Gynecology, Family Medicine, Surgery and Orthopedics.
HEAL Africa is a Congolese not for profit association which has completely rebuilt itself after total destruction by the
volcano, with assistance from many friends in USA and around the world. They have a state of the art surgical suite, but
the buildings hastily erected in the aftermath of the volcano are inappropriate for the quality of care they wish to offer
to patients: they deserve better.
We wish to request that the State Department give assistance to HEAL Africa to increase the quality of their services and
training capacity through the newly announced package of financial aid. We would like to ask you to fund the
construction of the three storey building which is the final stage of reconstruction of the hospital after the catastrophe
of the volcano in January 2002. The second floor of this building will be entirely devoted to women's fistula services;
and the whole hospital is devoted to teaching and preparing Congolese doctors to give excellent service in the most
underserved areas of Congo.
Many visitorsirom the US Embassy in Kinshasa, from USAID in Washington and Nairobi, the Secretary General of the
United Nations Mr Ban Ki Moon, Ms Rice from the Security Council, US senators and deputies, and a great number of
aides from your government have visited HEAL Africa and have come away enchanted by a hospital of excellence run
entirely by Congolese staff of the highest caliber. They are hoping that, through your visit, you will be able to advocate

Forum for the Future
RELEASE IN FULL
The Forum for the Future is a joint initiative of the countries of the Broader Middle
East and North Africa region (BMENA) and the industrialized countries of the
Group of Eight (G8). It is a unique partnership between governments of the
region, the G8, civil society representatives and private sector leaders to discuss
and exchange ideas on how to best work together to support progress and expand
opportunities for the people of the region.
The Forum for the Future was launched at the Sea Island G8 Summit in the United
States in June, 2004. During this summit, the G8 countries stressed their
commitment to promote progress in the BMENA region and to help establish an
environment conducive to an informal, flexible, open and inclusive dialogue. The
first Forum for the Future was held in Rabat in December 2004, co-hosted by The
Kingdom of Morocco and the United States.
In preparation for the 2009 ministerial, co-chairs Morocco and Italy along with
civil society partners convened three preparatory workshops across the region on:
economic reform (September 26-27, Beirut, Lebanon, in partnership with the
Organization for Civil Activities), political reform (October 5-6, Rabat, Morocco,
in partnership with the Moroccan Organization for Human Rights), and human
development (October 12-13, Doha, Qatar, in partnership with the National Human
Rights Committee and the Arab Democracy Foundation).
The BMENA Initiative complements the objectives outlined by President Obama
in his Cairo speech and is a natural partner for making progress in key areas —
notably economic opportunity, education, good governance, human rights, and
women's empowerment. BMENA's emphasis on cooperation among
governments, civil society and the private sector aligns with the President's vision
of partnership between the United States and countries in the region. The United
States will engage with leaders from the region on issues of common interest and
shared values, working together to infuse new energy into the partnership. In
particular, we believe our focus should be firmly on developing a path to
increasing opportunity for the youth of the region.
The Broader Middle East and North Africa participants include Afghanistan,
Algeria, Bahrain, Egypt, Iraq, Jordan, Kuwait, Lebanon, Libya, Morocco, Oman,
Pakistan, Qatar, Saudi Arabia, Syria, Tunisia, United Arab Emirates, West Bank
and Gaza, and Yemen.
The G8 countries include Canada, France, Germany, Italy, Japan, Russia, the
United Kingdom, and the United States.

Broader Middle East and North Africa
Democracy Assistance Dialogue
While many initiatives launched under the G8-Broader Middle East and North
Africa (BMENA) umbrella continue to make advances, the most striking progress
is in the Democracy Assistance Dialogue (DAD), which brings together NGOs and
governments in an ongoing basis to advance democratic reform in the region.
Representing a network of hundreds of BMENA NGOs and government
representatives, and with multilateral support, the DAD is now focused on in-
country activities that will implement reform recommendations from the Forum
deliberations. To date, the DAD has convened activities in Morocco, Algeria,
Jordan, Turkey, Yemen, and Italy. The DAD represents a series of thematic
meetings, activities and research characterized by consultation and partnership
between governments and civil society. The DAD's three areas of focus are
women's empowerment, political pluralism, and freedom of expression.
The DAD partners developed "A Partnership between G8, BMENA Governments
and Civil Society." This Partnership Document reflects the contributions of many
BMENA governments and civil society leaders alike and outlines a framework of
universal, democratic principles to strengthen the relationship and partnership
between governments and civil society in the region. This document was
acknowledged by government and civil society representatives at the 2008 Abu
Dhabi Forum and is a product of based on substantive discussions and
deliberations between civil society and governments that began nearly two years
ago.
Since its inception more than five years ago, the DAD has facilitated effective and
successful relationships between willing governments, NGOs, the media, political
leaders and civil society experts in the region, and has created a collaborative and
transparent environment in which to accomplish this partnership. DAD partners'
work on in-country programs, including women's empowerment in Algeria, Jordan
and Pakistan, and as well programs in Morocco and Yemen that are focused on
freedom of expression, political party and electoral reform, are notable.

1P 23: BACKGROUND ON FORUM FOR THE FUTURE
From an idea of partnership to a growing reality, the Broader Middle East
and North Africa (BMENA) Initiative represents genuine cooperation
between the G8 and European nations and the governments, business, and
civil society of the region to expand opportunities and prosperity for all.
e The leaders of the G8 industrialized nations and BMENA countries
launched the Partnership for Progress and a Common Future a blueprint
for how G8 and Middle Eastern countries could best work together to
support indigenous calls for reform — at the 08 Sea Island, Georgia,
summit in June 2004.
O The centerpiece of BMENA is the Forum for the Future, an annual
gathering of 08, European, and BMENA Foreign Ministers with civil
society to discuss and advance the reform agenda.
O The Forum for the Future provides a unique venue for BMENA civil
society organizations to meet with their government ministers as equal
participants. The Forum fosters constructive government-civil society
interaction to solve complex political, economic, and social problems of
participating countries.
O This year's Forum will include approximately 40 civil society
representatives who participate directly alongside governments. Civil
society participation in the Forum has risen considerably every year since
the first Forum in Morocco in 2004, when only five leaders participated.
e Foreign ministers from across the BMENA region, the 08, and other
partner countries now work with these organizations to further progress
and development in the areas of good governance, civil society,
economic prosperity, and education.
e This year, civil society organizations coordinated three preparatory
meetings involving governments of the region with a cross-section of
civil society leaders to outline priorities and develop recommendations
for the Forum ministerial.

The Secretary's Participation in the Forum for the Future
Tuesday, November 3, 2009
CONTEXT
You will participate in the Sixth Annual Forum for the Future and deliver a speech
that will highlight the importance of partnership within and across societies to
address common issues and elaborate on the steps the United States has taken to
enact the President's Cairo vision. This year's co-chairs, Italy and Morocco, and
civil-society groups selected political, economic, and social themes for discussion,
the latter of which includes issues such as education and the empowerment of
women. Your participation in the Forum shows continued U.S. support for
indigenous efforts of reform and development, and reinforces the importance
the U.S. attaches to greater cooperation between Broader Middle East and
North Africa (BMENA) governments and civil-society organizations in the
region.
KEY OBJECTIVES/ANNOTATED AGENDA:
I. Opening Session
The Forum's co-chairs, Moroccan Foreign Minister Fassi Fihri and Italian
Foreign Minister Frattini, will deliver opening remarks. You will then deliver
remarks for approximately 15-20 minutes.
Theme 1 — Political Reform / Local Governance and Democracy
The key to advancing and sustaining progress is action on the local level; civil
society groups and governments must develop effective working relationships
to benefit their citizens. While expanding the role of civil society is a long-term
effort between the citizens of the BMENA countries and their governments, we see
progress in some areas, including increased women's political participation, such
as in Morocco and Kuwait. The region's civil society continues to work toward
broadening the space for citizens to participate actively in public affairs,
particularly at the local level. Regrettably, some governments in the region have
sought to curtail the essential freedoms of expression and association. The United
States supports opening the political space for civil society to contribute ideas and
priorities to government policy-makers in shaping the future of the BMENA
countries.

HI. Theme 2 — Economic Reform / The Impact of the Financial Crisis on the
Economics of the BMENA Region
Sustainable progress requires opening spaces for innovation and creativity,
particularly for young people and women. Expanding opportunities for
entrepreneurs is key to addressing job creation, supporting economic development,
and furthering civic engagement. By assisting the growth of small and medium
enterprises (SMEs) through easing business regulations, enhancing transparency
and accountability, and improving access to financing, countries foster economic
growth and give society new sources of resilience. Additionally, educational
systems need to be responsive to labor-market needs. The United States supports
employment-focused approaches to education, as well as engagement with the
private sector to tackle comprehensively the obstacles that hinder economic growth
and development in the region.
IV. Theme S— Social Development: A New Perspective on Human Security
The United States supports sustainable development in all sectors of society.
Women's empowerment — political, economic, social, and cultural — is a
prerequisite for progress. Women across the region have been breaking silence
around many controversial issues, from breast cancer to domestic violence. We
applaud these efforts and will continue to support women who are working to raise
the levels of education, health, rights, and opportunity in their countries.
V. Closing Session
Concluding remarks will be delivered by the 2009 civil-society co-partners,
the Moroccan Organization for Human Rights and Italy's No Peace Without
Justice. Canada, as the next G8 president and Forum co-host in 2010, and the next
BMENA co-host will discuss plans and priorities for the 2010 Forum. After
Foreign Minister Frattini's closing remarks, Foreign Minister Fassi-Fihri will
present the Chair's Summary. The summary is traditionally drafted by the regional

Subject: Strategic Communications for Pakistan
Hello Madame Secretary. I hope you have a productive trip to Pakistan. I wanted to let you know that Ambassador
Haqqani asked me to submit a proposal to help the Government of Pakistan strengthen its communications with the
Pakistani public.
You may recall that my firm did similar hands-on work in Lebanon. The idea is to enhance the Government's internal
capacity to raise public awareness of its accomplishments, build support for its policies, and demonstrate the benefits of
democratic governance.
With stronger communications, they'd obviously be in a better position to convey the benefits of the US-Pakistan
relationship. We've followed Pakistani media coverage of Kerry-Lugar -- with more strategic communications
management by the Government, that could have been a positive story.
(The anti-American forces have used the same messages to attack US aid packages for at least 10 years. It was easy to
see the attacks coming.)
Communications help won't solve the immediate political crisis, but it could be one useful element of a larger strategic
communications strategy.

I understand there's a strategic communications working group focused on Pakistan. Would you like me to meet with
anyone to discuss this idea? I'm told Ashley Bommer is working on it. (I don't know her).
By the way - we're making headway on our campaign for Global Women's Issues - hope to have more to report soon!

France: 'Autistic Tories have castrated UK in Europe'
French Europe minister says David Cameron's pledge to reclaim EU powers is 'pathetic' and will leave Britain isolated

guardian.co.uk <http://www.guardian.co.uk>, Wednesday 4 November 2009 21.30 GMT
The Conservatives <http://www.guardian.co.uk/politics/conservatives> were accused by the French government
tonight of "castrating" Britain's position within the EU by adopting an "autistic" approach that would take Britain off the
radar.
Speaking to the Guardian, Pierre Lellouche, France's Europe minister, described as "pathetic" the Tories' EU plans
announced today, warning they would not succeed "for a minute".
Giving vent to frustration across the EU, which has so far only been expressed in private, Lellouche — who said he was
reflecting Nicolas Sarkozy's "sadness and regret" — accused William Hague, the shadow foreign secretary, of a "bizarre
autism" in their discussions.
He said: "They have one line and they just repeat one line. It is a very bizarre sense of autism."
Lellouche, one of the most Anglophile members of Sarkozy's government, made his remarkable intervention after David
Cameron <http://www.guardian.co.uk/politics/davidcameron> outlined a fresh Tory approach to the EU in the wake of
the full ratification of the Lisbon treaty.
A future Conservative government would seek to strengthen British sovereignty and repatriate a series of powers over
social and employment legislation, the Tory leader said.
Cameron said he was not seeking an immediate "bust-up" with the EU, and would allow the repatriation of powers
negotiations to last as long as five years.
But that position was not enough for the Tory MEP Daniel Hannan, who quit his role as the party's legal affairs
spokesman in Europe, saying he intended to fight for referendums to enable Britain to become "self-governing".
France's centre-right government condemned Cameron's plans, saying that they would marginalise Britain within the
EU.
Abandoning all diplomatic niceties, Lellouche said: "It's pathetic. It's just very sad to see Britain, so important in Europe,
just cutting itself out from the rest and disappearing from the radar map .... This is a culture of opposition ... It is the
result of a long period of opposition. I know they will come back, but I hope the trip will be short." He said Cameron's
approach was in line with the Tories' decision to abandon the main centre-right EPP grouping in the European
parliament, of which Sarkozy's UMP party is a member.
"They are doing what they have done in the European parliament. They have essentially castrated your UK influence in
the European parliament," he said.
Lellouche said he has told Hague personally that his position was a "waste of time for all of us".
"I have told William Hague: go away for two to three years, in your political economic situation you're going to be all by
your self and you'll come back. Go ahead and do it. That is my message to them ... You want to be marginalised? Well,
you go for it. But it's a waste of time for all of us," the French minister said.
Lellouche made clear the Tories had no hope of securing support for their plans. "It's not going to happen for a minute.
Nobody is going to indulge in rewriting [treaties for] many, many years. Nobody is going to play with the institutions
again. It's going to be take it or leave it and they should be honest and say that," he said. "It is a time of tumultuous
waters all around us. Wars, terrorism, proliferation, Afghanistan, energy with Russia, massive immigration, economic
crisis. It is time when the destiny of Europe is being defined — whether or not we will exist as a third of the world's GDP
capable of fighting it out on climateion trade, on every ... issue on the surface of the Earth.
"We need to be united, otherwise we will be wiped out and marginalised. None of us can do it alone. Whether you're big
or small, the lesson is the same. And [Britain's] risk is one of marginalisation. Irrelevance." He explained: "Finally we have
institutional package, but it took 15 years of looking at our navel and getting everybody bored to death with sterile
debate"
In a sign of France's determination to resist the Tory plans to opt out of key EU legislation, Lellouche warned the French
would attempt to reduce Britain's EU budget rebate which will be up for negotiation during the next parliament.
He pointed out that France is a net EU contributor to the tune of €5bn (E4.5bn), unlike Britain which receives a rebate.
"If we get a government that is ferociously anti European that will vote down this kind of legislation then I think the
relationship is going to be very difficult. As we enter the next phase one of the issues we have to discuss midterm is of

course finances. France is a net contributor to the tune of €5bn a year, of which €1.5bn is the same as British rebate.
That should tell you quite a bit huh?" he said.
Cameron will be angered by the attack, and what it implies for Tory relations with the rest of Europe although in the
short term he will be more concerned to ensure his strategy of abandoning a referendum on the Lisbon treaty does not
provoke cries of betrayal on his backbenches.
Hague reacted to the French criticism by insisting that Lellouche's comments did not represent the true reception of the
Tories' plans in Europe.
"That is not how we are seen across Europe," he told BBC2's Newsnight, adding his party had established good relations
with Sarkozy's party.
"I don't think you will find that's representative of the reaction in Paris or other European capitals," he added.

Re: Agenda with Merkel
The Transatlantic Economic Council was Chancellor Angela Merkel's major initiative when Germany held the EU
presidency in 2007. She got President George W. Bush to agree to its formation. But the council now languishes. Has the
US appointed its representative? The council is more about coordinating regulatory matters than trade, by the way.
Raising Merkel's project and reinvigorating it would undoubtedly be well received. Below is an article from Europolitics
Daily from January 2009 on the council. State could work this up.

future By Brian Beary in Washington I Friday 16 January 2009
As Barack Obama was coasting to victory last November, the leader of the Socialist MEPs, Martin Schulz, urged him to
"make sure Europe is on the top of his in-tray". Two months on, there is considerable doubt as to whether Obama will
indeed take this advice or leave Europe lingering towards the bottom of the pile. Nowhere is this danger more striking

than with the Transatlantic Economic Council (TEC), the body German Chancellor Angela Merkel persuaded President
George Bush to set up in April 2007 to remove regulatory barriers to transatlantic trade.
STILL NO TEC CHAIR
Obama has been widely praised for moving quickly, by comparison to previous new presidents, to nominate his new
administration. Yet his spokesman told Europolitics he has still not appointed the future co-chair of the TEC. In the
interim, Michelle O'Neill, Deputy Undersecretary at the Department of Commerce, has been tasked with ensuring
continuity. The EU Co-Chair is Commission Vice-President Gunter Verheugen. Given that dozens of nominations have
already been announced, this may be a sign that among his long list of priorities, the TEC, the most significant EU-US
initiative to emerge in recent years, will not feature highly. It should be noted that when Obama was chair of the Senate
Subcommittee on Europe, from 2007 to 2008, he did not organise a single hearing, something on which his then rival in
the presidential campaign, Senator Hillary Clinton, tried - and failed - to score political points.
The Democrats, who have grown more protectionist-minded on trade, now have a commanding majority in both the US
Senate and House of Representatives. Obama, himself a Democrat, is being careful to cultivate good relations with them
and not take for granted their support, which he desperately needs to push through his ambitious economic policy
agenda. It was Congress that in 2007 introduced the 100% rule, requiring all US-bound containers leaving European
ports to be scanned before being loaded onto the departing ship. This has been a thorn in the EU's side ever since and
now features on the TEC agenda. In the current climate, Congress is unlikely to be clamouring to scrap the rule and may
not even wish to extend the 2012 implementation deadline as the EU is asking. Anxious not to burn bridges, Obama
could well go along with Congress in order to avoid an unnecessary fight.
AMERICANS NOT SO HOT ON TRADE
Congress' protectionism does not magically appear in a vacuum. It is reflective of mounting fears among the US public
about the impact free trade has on US jobs. Their fears are not entirely groundless. American manufacturing jobs are
indeed going overseas - notably to India and China. And being unemployed in the US is a more perilous predicament
than in Europe because government unemployment benefits are less generous and more temporary. Moreover, most
Americans, unlike Europeans, have their health care paid for by their employer so if they lose their job they also lose
their health care. Hardly surprising, therefore, that only 59% of Americans think trade is good for their country,
compared to 78% of French and British, 80% of Czechs and 85% of Germans, a Pew Research Centre survey has shown.
This bearish sentiment has a knock-on effect on all trade dossiers. For example, it makes Congress less amenable to
scrapping the law requiring US airlines to be in 'actual control' of US citizens - something the EU is urging in the current
Open Sky II aviation liberalisation talks. It makes US lawmakers more likely to take action to prevent European
companies winning lucrative US defence contracts. This is happening already with the epic tussle between Boeing and
Airbus over the Pentagon's US$35 billion refuelling tanker contract (see separate article). EU officials are clinging to the
hope that Obama, as president, will adopt a more global outlook and drag the Democratic Congress along with him
rather than the other way around.
A VICTIM OF DULLNESS?
The TEC, despite having failed to deliver as much as many hoped for, remains an extremely useful tool. By emphasising
regulatory rather than tariff barriers, it shows an understanding of where the real problems lie in today's trading
environment. The EU and the US could use the TEC to create a global standard in hugely important sectors, such as toys
and food. "The alternative," as Dan Hamilton, director of the Centre for Transatlantic Relations at Johns Hopkins
University in Washington notes, "is that we end up with Chinese standards".
Yet the TEC has one weakness no one should underestimate: its dullness. Discussing highly technical regulatory
divergences, such as whether to wash chickens in chlorine or water, may have been Chancellor Merkel's cup of tea but
French President Nicolas Sarkozy showed little interest in it during the French EU Presidency. Without strong impetus
from someone on Obama's team who has the power to make things happen, the TEC - like an old soldier - might not
actually die but just fade away.
EU-US economy
While there is much talk about the rising power of China and India, the transatlantic economy still far outstrips the rest
of the world in size and wealth. The EU27 and the US accounted for nearly 57% of world gross domestic product in 2007,
while the transatlantic economy made up 47% of world exports and 52% of world imports. The net worth per household
in the US is US$565,000, in France US$518,000, in the U.K. US$599,000, compared to just US$18,000 in China,
US$31,000 in Russia and US$44,000 Brazil.

Holds, delays on Cabinet picks hurting American businesses
By Nelson W. Cunningham - 10/06/09 03:45 PM ET
UNCLASSIFIED U.S. Department of State Case No. F-2014-20439 Doc No. C05760158 Date: 07/31/2015
UNCLASSIFIED U.S. Department of State Case No. F-2014-20439 Doc No. C05760158 Date: 07/31/2015
You may never have heard of the Under Secretary of Commerce for International Trade, or the Under Secretary of
Treasury for International Affairs. You may have vaguely assumed there was a Deputy United States Trade
Representative, and an Assistant Secretary of State for Western Hemisphere Affairs, and an ambassador to Brazil, but
never thought much of them or what they do.
But ask American CEOs and business leaders who they turn to in Washington for help getting a fair shake in foreign
markets or untying global trade knots, and you will learn that these are the very officials they rely on. Yet today, when
every export dollar and trade-supported job is essential to America's economic recovery, these key positions sit empty.
And, surprisingly, these five seats are empty because of stalls and behind-the-scenes maneuvers by Senate Republicans
— usually key allies of U.S. business.
In each case, the names went up months ago. The nominees have strong credentials and many have demonstrated
strong bipartisan support. The reasons for the holds and delays vary. But even if the blocking actions are unrelated,
collectively they deny American businesses their most effective overseas advocates.
•Miriam Sapiro, who was unanimously approved by the Finance Committee in July to be Deputy United States Trade
Representative with responsibility for trade agreements and enforcement with Europe and the Americas (including
NAFTA), has a one-man hold by Sen. Jim Bunning (R-Ky.) over a Canadian tobacco bill.
•Arturo Valenzuela, nominee for Assistant Secretary of State for Western Hemisphere, was overwhelmingly approved by
the Senate Foreign Relations Committee in July, but Sen. Jim DeMint (R-S.C.) has a one-man hold on Valenzuela as a
protest against the administration's Honduras policy.
•Thomas Shannon, nominee for ambassador to Brazil, is also being blocked by Sen. DeMint over Honduras. Shannon is
hardly political, but is a career foreign service officer who was President Bush's top official for Latin America at the NSC
and then the State Department.
•Francisco Sanchez, nominated in April to be Under Secretary of Commerce for International Trade, responsible for
advancing U.S. export and trade opportunities around the world. Republican staff under Sen. Chuck Grassley (R-Iowa) on
the Finance Committee have repeatedly delayed a hearing.
•Lael Brainard, nominated in March to be Under Secretary of Treasury for International Affairs, is also being held up by
the Republican staff on the Finance Committee. With an empty chair in this powerful position — it was previously held
by future Treasury Secretaries Timothy Geithner and Lawrence Summers — our ability to coordinate a response to the
financial crisis is hampered at a time when we can't afford it.
Who is hurt by these holds and staff delays? Certainly the president, who is facing the worst economic crisis in 50 years,
a stalled trade agenda, and economic and political turmoil in many parts of Latin America, including the hot-button crisis
in Honduras.
But U.S. businesses are also hurt. When American companies find themselves in commercial or trade disputes abroad, or
face unfair competition from foreign companies or discriminatory practices from regulators, they turn directly to the
roster above. With all these chairs empty, U.S. businesses with problems abroad find themselves facing a classic
Goldilocks problem — the Cabinet secretaries above are too big (and too busy), and the officials below are too small to
have an impact at the right levels.
Moreover, the international economic issues of greatest interest to U.S. businesses are precisely the ones that are being
hampered by these vacancies: balanced and coordinated growth out of the Great Recession, promotion of job-
generating U.S. exports, delayed trade agreements with Colombia and Panama, barriers into Brazil's huge market, trade
tensions with Canada (our largest trading partner) and security and border issues with Mexico (our second-largest),
among many others.

UNCLASSIFIED U.S. Department of State Case No. F-2014-20439 Doc No. C05760158 Date: 07/31/2015
And while all U.S. business interests overseas are affected by these vacancies, it is our business and political interests in
the Americas that are being hit most directly, because of the responsibilities and expertise of the five nominees.
Predictably, this lamentable situation is renewing cries from our neighbors that even under a promising new president,
they continue to be neglected. And as importantly, our ability to help shape political and economic events in our
hemisphere to advance U.S. interests is suffering greatly. Who wins when we can't act? Our foreign competitors; not
just foreign companies, but Hugo Chavez and his anti-democratic allies.
All this is not to cast blame on the United States Senate, which has a constitutional duty to provide "advice and consent"
on presidential nominations (though it may cause one to question the tradition that permits a single senator to put an
indefinite hold on a nominee). Nor is it to cast blame solely on Republican members or staff. Democratic senators and
their staffs used these same parliamentary maneuvers under Republican presidents.
But it is to say that those who engage in those tactics now — at a time of global economic crisis and with growing
financial, trade and political frictions in our own hemisphere — should be reminded of the harm done to important U.S.
interests. In the days after 9/11, the Democratically-controlled Senate moved swiftly to confirm the U.N. ambassador
and other stalled security-related posts. Today's circumstances are not the same by any means, but as we confront the
worst economic crisis in over 50 years, these are surely no ordinary times.
The time has come for the Senate to carry out its constitutional duty and to end the delays on these five key commerce
and trade nominations. American business deserves an A Team by its side.

Clinton set to smooth Obama's visit to China
By Edward Luce in Washington and Geoff Dyer in Beijing
Published: November 4 2009 02:00 I Last updated: November 4 2009 02:00
Hillary Clinton is on course to raise the $61m in private money needed to build a US pavilion for a trade fair in Shanghai
next year, Clearing one of the main foreign policy obstacles ahead of Barack Obama's state visit to China next week.
Mrs Clinton, whose first visit as secretary of state was to China, inherited a situation where the US was the only country
other than Andorra that had failed to confirm its attendance at the Shanghai Expo - to the chagrin of the Chinese.
America's absence from the fair, running from May to October, was the first issue to be raised by the Chinese when Mrs
Clinton visited in February. "The Chinese were very upset," says Elizabeth Baghley, who heads Mrs Clinton's office for
global partnerships. "When she came back from China she said: 'Whatever it takes, this matters to China and to US
business and we are going to get this done'."
UNCLASSIFIED U.S. Department of State Case No. F-2014-20439 Doc No. C05760164 Date: 06/30/2015

The task was more arduous than expected. Unlike all the other participants in what is expected to be the largest trade
fair in history, the US administration is barred by federal law from spending a single public dollar on global trade fairs.
Mrs Clinton, who has extensive experience at fundraising as a presidential and senatorial candidate, was also prevented
from asking for money herself.
The bureaucratic obstacles were made worse by the fact the Chinese had already tapped large US companies, such as
Cisco and Coca-Cola, to spend money on their own corporate pavilions, which will face their national counterparts
across the river around the fair in Shanghai. The situation was retrieved when three companies - Chevron, GE and
PepsiCo - were persuaded to put up $5m (€3.4m, £3m) each. So far $46m has been pledged.
Mrs Clinton's emphasis on getting a US pavilion contrasted strongly with the attitude of the Bush administration. Some
even referred disparagingly to the "Chi-comms" - an old-fashioned abbreviation for Chinese communists. "The state
department basically saw it as a lost cause," says one state department official. "Some people laughed when they heard
Hillary wanted to do this."
Shanghai has huge hopes for the Expo, which it sees as a chance to cement the city's global brand as an international
financial centre and modern metropolis. With an official budget of Rmb28.6bn ($4.2bn) and 70m expected visitors over
the six months, the Expo has been marketed as the sort of coming-out party for Shanghai that last year's Olympics was
for Beijing - and an event to rival the great 19th century world fairs in London, Paris and Chicago.
Given such heady expectations for what will be the world's largest fair, the absence of the US would have been
considered a huge slight and a loss of face for the Chinese. Mindful of how much it mattered to the Chinese, Mrs Clinton
saw it as an opportunity to build their trust. During strategic and economic talks with Chinese counterparts in
Washington last summer, Mrs Clinton vowed she would get it done even if she had to "build it myself, brick by brick".
Mrs Clinton was also backed by John Huntsman, the US ambassador to China and former governor of Utah, who
repeatedly told Washington how much symbolic value it would bring to China.
Mrs Clinton, who will be with the US president on his state visit next week, is expected to visit the site and may be in a
position to announce that all the money has been raised.

Hillary's Moment: Clinton Faces the World By Joe Klein Time Magazine Wednesday, Nov. 04, 2009
It was Halloween night in Jerusalem, and Benjamin Netanyahu came dressed as a peacemaker. "We're prepared to start
peace talks immediately," the notoriously reluctant Israeli Prime Minister proclaimed, with U.S. Secretary of State Hillary
Clinton standing at his side, poker-faced. "I think we should ... get on it and get with it."
It was a ploy, of course. The Palestinians were tangled up in themselves, yet again. They had elections looming, and their
leader, Mahmoud Abbas, had to hang tough: he was demanding a total freeze to Israeli settlement-building on the West
Bank — which was precisely what the Obama Administration had previously said it favored. Netanyahu was offering a
partial freeze, not including new settlements in East Jerusalem, the desired capital of a future Palestinian state. This was
a nonstarter for the Palestinians, but it had the holographic glow of a step forward. It was an "unprecedented" offer,
Netanyahu trumpeted, with the joy of a chess master springing a trap.(See photos from 60 years of Israel.)
It was a tough moment for Clinton, playing second fiddle at the Bibi-does-Gandhi show. President Barack Obama had
softened his language on the settlements a few weeks earlier: instead of a total freeze, he had talked about Israeli
"restraint" in settlement-building. And now Clinton seemed to cement the Administration's retreat, agreeing that
Netanyahu's proposal was, indeed, "unprecedented," even though the U.S. still favored a total freeze. The most
important thing, she added, was for the parties to get to the table as quickly as possible. The onus was back on the
Palestinians — and the Palestinians quickly expressed outrage at the Obama Administration's retreat. Their Arab
neighbors soon joined in, causing Clinton to backtrack two days later, telling reporters the Israeli plan "falls far short" of
U.S. expectations, although she still insisted on calling it "unprecedented," which was neither diplomatic nor wise.
Suddenly the Obama Administration seemed wobbly on the Middle East; clearly, Clinton had been too bullish on
Netanyahu's proposal (which had been negotiated over months with Middle East envoy George Mitchell and was seen,
privately, by the Americans as real progress). But the Administration's mission was to get the parties into peace talks
without preconditions. The Israelis were now in favor of talks. The Palestinians were setting preconditions. And Clinton
had violated an essential rule of her job: boring is almost always better.(See photos from the life and career of former
Secretary of State Madeleine Albright.)
Clinton's Three Qualities

For the past 40 years, the awkward Middle East press conference has helped define the job of Secretary of State. You go
to Jerusalem or Ramallah; you stand there "guardedly optimistic" in public; in private, you try to move a comma, but the
Israelis or Palestinians move a semicolon to block your comma. The result is almost always the same: gridlock. The
breakthroughs, when they come, emanate from others. Walter Cronkite asks Anwar Sadat if he'd be willing to go to
Jerusalem ... and Sadat, to everyone's surprise, says yes. The Israelis and Palestinians hold secret meetings in Oslo and
reach what appears to be a breakthrough — they're talking! — which then becomes another dead end.
The job of Secretary of State is more thankless than glamorous; in some ways, the Department of State, a noble antique,
is still trying to come to terms with the invention of the telephone. In an era when Twitter haiku-messaging rules,
diplomacy moves at the speed, and requires the nuanced complexity, of literature. Power has drifted from State to the
National Security Council and the Pentagon, especially in wartime. Only a few of Clinton's recent predecessors have
distinguished themselves. Henry Kissinger, a National Security Adviser who belatedly became Secretary of State, was
Richard Nixon's schizophrenic alter ego; George Shultz was a strong policy voice in the Reagan Administration; James
Baker had clout because he was George H.W. Bush's best friend and a world-class dealmaker. Most of the others have
been frustrated or forgettable. And yet this is Hillary Clinton we're talking about — the second most popular American in
the world, an eternally compelling and supremely talented character, the subject of constant speculation, a walking
headline. Her very presence in the job makes it crucial once more.
It is a cliché to say that by naming Clinton, Obama brought his most popular potential opponent into the tent. The
conventional wisdom, too cynical by half, is that he thereby succeeded in neutering her, a theory bolstered by Clinton's
reticence during her first nine months on the job, with special envoys like Mitchell and Richard Holbrooke doing the
heavy lifting of diplomacy. But by naming Clinton, Obama also gave her great power, which cuts both ways: if she
becomes dissatisfied with her role or the Administration's policies, she can become a torpedo aimed at the Oval Office.
Colin Powell had similar power and a real gripe — the Iraq war — but never used it. Clinton has no such gripe, but as the
Obama Administration settles in and policy differences begin to emerge among the key players, the Powell conundrum
looms: How will Clinton choose to use her power? How will Obama react if and when she does?
Traditionally, the Secretary of State is judged on his or her ability to formulate policy, negotiate deals and manage the
striped-pants bureaucracy. Clinton has no history as a global strategist, although her performance in the 2008 campaign
indicates that she is a bit more conservative than the President, more the foreign policy realist than the Wilsonian
idealist. It is also too early to judge her skill as a manager or negotiator — although her performance in Jerusalem
indicates that she needs a few lessons in Middle East Haggling 101.
There are, however, three qualities that could make her a memorable Secretary of State. She brings a vision of
departmental reform — the need to elevate foreign aid programs to the same status and rigorous scrutiny as diplomacy
— that could change striped pants into chinos in the developing world. She is also the first elected politician to hold the
office since Edmund Muskie briefly did during the Carter Administration, which has enabled her to better understand
and interact with the politicians who run places like Afghanistan and Pakistan. But most important, she is an
international celebrity with a much higher profile than any of her recent predecessors and the ability — second only to
the President's — to change negative attitudes about the U.S. abroad.
She has the potential to become the most powerful public diplomat the U.S. has fielded in quite some time, although
her performance so far, at home and abroad, has occasionally been perplexing. At home, she has often seemed
tentative and deferential. In a conversation with Secretary of Defense Robert Gates aired by CNN in early October,
Clinton's cautious formality took a backseat to Gates' brisk, humorous confidence on policy issues. Abroad, she seems
far more confident, at times to the point of recklessness, as in Jerusalem. (See photos of the last days of Hillary Clinton's
campaign.)
Independence and Candor
In the last week of October, Secretary Clinton moved squarely to the center of the world stage, attempting, at the
behest of her special envoys, to improve the rocky alliance with Pakistan and nudge the Middle East pugilists into talks.
In the course of the trip, there were the first stray wisps of a hint that Clinton wanted to begin asserting her
UNCLASSIFIED U.S. Department of State Case No. F-2014-20439 Doc No. C05760165 Date: 06/30/2015
UNCLASSIFIED U.S. Department of State Case No. F-2014-20439 Doc No. C05760165 Date: 06/30/2015
independence, as the Administration, facing roadblocks across the world, struggled for a firmer foreign policy tone after
an opening nine months that might be called the Rodney King — "Can't we all just get along?" — phase.
During her three days in Pakistan, she ran a gauntlet of town-hall meetings and media interviews that may have been
unprecedented, to use the word of the week, for a U.S. Secretary of State. The trip, planned by Holbrooke and Pakistan
specialist Vali Nasr, offered an unusually subtle itinerary for a U.S. diplomatic mission. A visit to a Sufi mosque that had
been bombed by Sunni extremists, for example, sent a powerful message to Pakistan's moderate Islamic majority. "We
saw her praying there," an academic named Shala Aziz told me, "and, for the first time, I'm thinking, The Americans have
hearts."(See photos of the suicide bombings in Islamabad.)
The big news was that Clinton allowed herself to be hammered with hostile questions from students, talk-show hosts
and Pashtun elders — and that, on occasion, she pushed back, raising incredibly sensitive issues, like why no one in the
Pakistani government knew where Osama bin Laden was, even though he had been in the country since 2002. Press
accounts either emphasized the embarrassment of a Secretary of State's getting pummeled or fixed on Clinton's
undiplomatic bluntness. But they missed the point: her candor, her willingness to listen to and acknowledge criticism,
had begun to undermine the prevailing Pakistani image of the U.S. as arrogant and bossy, more interested in having the
Pakistani military fight its war against al-Qaeda and the Taliban than in having a true strategic partnership. The contrast
was especially sharp after George W. Bush's eight years of unqualified support for the military dictatorship of Pervez
Musharraf. "In the past, when the Americans came, they would talk to the generals and go home," said Farahnaz
Ispahani, a government spokeswoman and Member of Parliament. "Clinton's willingness to meet with everyone, hostile
or not, has made a big impression — and because she's Hillary Clinton, with a real history of affinity for this country, it
means so much more."
Transformative Experience
There are no toasts at state dinners in Pakistan, because there is no alcohol. There are opening statements, though, and
Clinton's — delivered impromptu on the first night of her trip after tossing aside her notes — was surprisingly emotional.
Earlier in the day, President Asif Ali Zardari, the widower of Benazir Bhutto, had presented the Secretary with an album
of photos from her first visit to Pakistan, in 1995, and a framed photo of Bhutto and her two sons with Clinton and
daughter Chelsea. "It did bring tears to my eyes," Clinton said at the state dinner in her honor at the presidential palace,
"because I so admired your wife. She gave her life ..." She faltered then, choking up, but quickly pulled herself together,
talking about the "reasons why we do what we do — to provide opportunities for all."
Clinton's first trip to Pakistan as First Lady in 1995 had been a transformative experience for her — the beginning, I
believe, of the process that made her a plausible candidate for Secretary of State. I traveled with her on that trip; when
we set off, she seemed depressed and even more private than usual. The Democrats had cratered in the 1994
congressional elections, and she had been trounced in her efforts to enact a universal health care plan. It was a very
personal defeat; as Clinton traveled the country trying to sell the plan, crowds shouted her down and cursed her.
Privately she admitted she was shocked by the hatred. The trip to South Asia seemed a bit of a vacation — it was
Chelsea's spring break — but also a retreat to a more demure, First Lady–like role after two years as health care policy
czar, although it proceeded in a decidedly wonky, Hillarian fashion. Jackie Kennedy had gone to India and famously
ridden an elephant; Hillary Clinton traveled to five countries and packed her schedule with visits to NG0s.
"That was the greatest trip, just unbelievable," Clinton says now. We were sitting in her hotel suite the day after her
Jerusalem gaffe, the Secretary in an electric-blue shift rather than her usual formal jacket and pants. She was wearing
glasses and appeared rather freckly without her makeup. "I guess that trip has animated and informed everything I've
done since," she said. She emerged from the trip reinvigorated, with a new mission. By the end of 1995, at the U.N.
Conference on Women in Beijing, the First Lady had propounded a new Clinton Doctrine: "Women's rights are human
rights."(See photos of Beijing's changing skyline.)
Clinton is not an easy interview. She is preternaturally cautious, a consequence of her Methodist propriety and 20 years
of insane public scrutiny. She does not like to talk about herself, but she did tell me one interesting story about Bhutto.
When her husband was governor of Arkansas, she and Bill and Chelsea visited London and stood on the sidewalk outside

UNCLASSIFIED U.S. Department of State Case No. F-2014-20439 Doc No. C05760165 Date: 06/30/2015
Bhutto's hotel, waiting for the then Pakistani Prime Minister to arrive. "She was wearing a yellow embroidered shalwar
kameez with a chiffon scarf. I was just a fan, standing on the sidewalk with everyone else. It was the only time I ever did
anything like that," Clinton says.
When Clinton and Bhutto met formally, on the first day of the 1995 trip, they hit it off immediately, in part because
Bhutto was also obsessed with the impact the Islamist tide was having on women and children. I remember asking
Bhutto that day what the biggest change in her country had been over the past 25 years, and she said, "I used to be able
to walk down the street wearing jeans, without a headscarf. Now I can't." When I asked her why, she said — bluntly —
"The Saudis," who had been aggressively funding religious schools. Of course, Bhutto's acquiescence to, and
participation in, the general corruption of the Pakistani government was part of the reason public schools were so
inadequate and madrasahs became popular. (See photos from the aftermath of Benazir Bhutto's assassination in 2007.)
Ironically, the rise of Sunni extremist groups like al-Qaeda has brought Clinton's interests — microfinance, education and
health care — to the center of national-security policy for the first time. The impetus came not from the State
Department but from the military, where counterinsurgency doctrine demanded that social services in war zones —
schools, justice, economic development — reinforce the military's efforts to secure the population. As a result, there
was immediate chemistry between Clinton and General David Petraeus, author of the Army's counterinsurgency
manual, who became one of her prime military mentors when she served on the Senate Armed Services Committee. At
one point, well before Obama made his presidential intentions known, I asked Petraeus if there was any potential
Democratic candidate who understood how his mind worked, and he said, "You mean, aside from Hillary?"
It was Clinton who brought together Petraeus and Holbrooke ("my two alpha males," she calls them) for the first time —
at her home in Washington on the Friday before the Obama Inauguration. The affection and respect she gained for the
military while serving in the Senate has helped make the relationship between State and the Pentagon less fraught than
usual — although Defense Secretary Gates' insistence on the need for bigger State Department budgets hasn't hurt. In
fact, relations with the Pentagon have gone smoother, at times, than Clinton's relationship with the White House staff.
Clinton was particularly irritated by the ridiculously strict vetting process that thwarted her favored candidate for USAID
director, Paul Farmer, from getting the job. "It was all sorts of niggling things," says a Clinton adviser, "like, Farmer had
at one point brought more than $10,000 in cash into Haiti. The money was for a needle-exchange program, but the
amount was illegal."
Another of Clinton's military mentors, retired General Jack Keane, once told me, "I'm a Republican. I disagree with her
about practically everything, but she'd make a hell of a Commander in Chief." There is a palpable toughness to the
woman, a hard edge that contrasts with the President's instinctive impulse toward conciliation. One of the sharpest
exchanges of the presidential campaign came when Obama accused Clinton of echoing the "bluster" of George W. Bush
after she said the U.S. would be able to "obliterate" Iran if it used nuclear weapons against Israel. Clinton's edgier tone
has been evident from the start of the Administration: she took a sharper position than the President on an Israeli
settlement freeze by claiming, in May, that Obama wanted "to see a stop to settlements. Not some settlements, not
outposts, not natural-growth exceptions." And then, in Jerusalem, her use of the word unprecedented seemed a
rhetorical leap beyond the No Drama ground rules.(Read "Clinton's Collateral Damage.")
The White House was not entirely thrilled with either statement. But then the White House staff is several steps
removed from a negotiating process. The Palestinians are weak and divided. The Israelis have been difficult, as always:
whenever Mitchell raises East Jerusalem in talks with the Israeli Foreign Minister, the Israeli stands up and walks out of
the room. Despite Netanyahu's momentary, tactical enthusiasm for peace talks, his Likud Party has always favored the
de facto incorporation of Palestinian lands into the state of Israel.
Hillary's Choice
The tensions between the White House and State raise a fascinating question going forward. Obama and Clinton are in
substantive agreement on the President's diplomacy-first philosophy and on most policy issues — although neither is
willing to disclose the content of their private conversations — but style often predicts substance in foreign policy;
neither Obama's gauziness nor Clinton's inconsistent bluntness overseas seems particularly solid. There is a growing
UNCLASSIFIED U.S. Department of State Case No. F-2014-20439 Doc No. C05760165 Date: 06/30/2015
UNCLASSIFIED U.S. Department of State Case No. F-2014-20439 Doc No. C05760165 Date: 06/30/2015
perception that the Administration's policies have been thwarted across the board: Afghanistan is a mess, Iran seems
ready to scuttle the nuclear negotiations, there's no progress in the Middle East, the Syrians and North Koreans remain
recalcitrant, the Russians have been offered a freebie on missile defense, and the Chinese have been given a pass on
human rights with no apparent quid pro quos.
The White House argues that some progress has been made: Iran is on the defensive, and North Korea has said it will
return to the six-party talks. Clinton argues, correctly, about the need for "strategic patience." But the only thing Obama
really has to show for his efforts so far is a Nobel Prize for Potential and — no small thing — the wisdom to have
refrained from doing anything so wildly stupid as invading Iraq. The President has been willing to use military force —
the Predator drones that have decimated al-Qaeda's leadership testify to his lack of squeamishness — but this
Administration is supposed to be about the efficacy of using subtler expressions of U.S. power. That doesn't happen
overnight, but for Obama's policies to be considered a success, it has to happen sooner or later, in a way that can be
explained to the public.
There is also a growing sense that the President's inexperience is beginning to show — not in his overall policy, which
represents the views of a broad, moderate national-security consensus ranging from Brent Scowcroft to John Kerry, but
in his execution of the details. The Afghan strategy review has been too public and taken too long; the Middle East peace
hunt has become a wild goose chase. A letter to Iran's Supreme Leader is a productive gesture only if it gets a response;
if it doesn't, it seems weak and supplicatory. A call for the Israelis to freeze settlements is effective only if it is
accompanied by the credible threat of a reduction in aid. "You can't be seen pushing countries around — demanding
[that] Israel freeze settlements, demanding that Hamid Karzai reform his government — and not get results," says Leslie
H. Gelb, author of Power Rules. "The leaders of these countries are tough, successful politicians, and they'll begin to take
you less seriously." (See photos from the 1979 revolution in Iran.)
Clinton is unwilling to acknowledge these problems, and her staff is loath to admit her occasional mistakes. Her praise
for the President is fulsome, and aides say the relationship with Obama really — really — is strong. But there are also
burblings and emanations from Clinton's staff and friends, Foggy Bottom body language, that suggest there is a need for
the Administration to produce a second act after the Rodney King phase. And the White House is perplexed by the
uncharacteristic lack of discipline indicated by Clinton's occasional overseas gaffes.
These tensions are well within the boundaries of normal, creative policymaking. There is absolutely no indication that
the Secretary is frustrated to the point of jumping ship — or returning to politics as a candidate for governor of New
York, as has been rumored. Quite the contrary, she seems intent on making history as Secretary of State. To do that,
though, she will have to have the same authority at home as she has abroad. She will have to become the President's
primary foreign policy voice. Over the first nine months of the Obama Administration, seven different Obama officials
have spoken on the Sunday talk shows about foreign policy. Clinton has been on each of the Sunday shows once. "Either
you have one person sending the foreign policy message, with the clear approval of the President," says a former
Republican Secretary of State, "or there is no message."(See photos from eight months of Obama's diplomacy.)
Aides to Obama say they would like to see her on the Sunday shows more often. (Indeed, Clinton's staff acknowledged
that she was asked to appear two additional times but was traveling and unable to do so.) Ultimately, though, television
is a metaphor for the larger questions that need to be resolved: How much can these former rivals — both extremely
guarded and private people — really trust each other; and, if not Clinton, who will emerge as the President's alter ego
on foreign policy? At this point, the strongest member of Obama's national-security team is Gates — but he's a
Republican and an unlikely spokesman or presidential confidant on anything beyond Pentagon issues. General Jim Jones
has settled in as National Security Adviser, but he's not a political animal — and every President needs a close foreign
policy adviser who understands the intersection of long-term strategy, politics and diplomatic chess.
Clinton's value to the Administration was clear in Pakistan. She wowed a public so skeptical that it had been questioning
the $7.5 billion in purely economic and humanitarian aid the Administration had promised. "How much damage control
have you been able to do on this trip?" asked Meher Bokhari, a television-news-show host, at the end of Clinton's
meeting with Pakistani women. The Secretary seemed nonplussed by the bluntness of the question. "I don't know," she
said. "I hope some."

UNCLASSIFIED U.S. Department of State Case No. F-2014-20439 Doc No. C05760165 Date: 06/30/2015
Afterward, I asked Bokhari to answer her own question. "Well, this trip was long overdue," she said. "The Pakistani
people really needed to talk to an American about our concerns — the strings attached to aid programs, the drone
attacks, their history of support for the military dictatorship. And it needs to be followed up. But if you ask me about the
damage control" — she paused, thinking it through — "I'd have to say a lot. She accomplished a lot."
In the end, though, Clinton's success will be determined by whether she can expand her role beyond public diplomat.
She will have to become a more sure-handed negotiator and, most important, a trusted adviser to a President who
knows where he wants to go in the world but hasn't quite figured out how to get there.

I have to say that this argument that the Taliban are ok to ignore is dangerous morally and politically.
The argument at the time was that harboring terrorism was the same as launching terrorism and that those who
harbored would be held responsible. This also had long term deterrence value against regimes that would outsource the
dirty work.
To now even consider giving the Taliban a pass after harboring terrorists who committed direct attacks on new York and
Washington defies the imagination. This wasn't some embassy bombing but a strike right at our country. The white
house or congress barely escaped destruction. Saddam Hussein wasn't connected to al Qaeda but the Taliban surely
were without question.
And Teheran and north Korea are watching carefully, gauging how much resolve the us has in stopping their plans. If the
us lets the Taliban off the hook then they certainly can conclude it will do nothing beyond sanctions with them. And
essentially letting karzai twist in the wind also suggests the us does not live up to it's commitments, giving pause to
those who would help the us.
Politically, this is also quite dangerous. Obama maintained througout the campaign and the start of his presidency that
this is the one to fight and backing down here makes him and the administration vulnerable to losing moderate support
and seeming weak and indecisive.
A single terrorist incident would be blamed on the admin. failing to do the job right.
I could go on and on with other negative ramifications but of all the options it appears to me any strategy that says
fighting the taliban are not in the strategic interests of the us should be doa.

Dear Hillary,
I very much hope we have a chance to spend some time with you next week for the "Sanya Initiatove" in DC with four
other American Four Stars and our Chinese counterparts. You will recall this is part of what I've been trying to do under
our "complementary engagement" program, which I briefly mentioned to you.
I understand our offices are working on the schedules, but nothing is firm yet.
Your personal involvement with this group - perhaps a small lunch - would be a very important message seen at the
highest levels of the Chinese government and the Central Military Commission.
I'd be personally grateful not only on behalf of our group, but also on behalf of a cause that I believe will be a part of
leading to a trusting relationship between our militaries so that we will have friends in China - not enemies.,
Warm, best regards,

American Federation of Teachers
Education Support Team Mission
Kabul, Afghanistan
July-August 2009
Assignment
My plane departed New York Kennedy for Kabul on July 28th and the refrain replayed
and replayed in my head "you are going where? Afghanistan. And why?" I was recruited by the
AFT' s international department to support the Afghan Teacher Education Department's RPM
(Rapid Production of Materials) activity in which two dozen curriculum experts wrote teacher
training materials for classroom teachers. The other two members of the AFT team, Betty Harris
(ABC California) and Amber Prentice (St. Paul), arrived in late August
The RPM took place daily over a period of five weeks at the Sayyed Jumalladin Teacher
Training College in Kabul. Twenty Afghan educators were organized into three groups, each
responsible for completing the training manuals for one grade level (4-6, 7-9 and 10-12). For
each subject at each grade level, a module of five 90-minute training sessions was created. This
activity was part of the ongoing USAID program aimed at providing in-service training to all
Afghan teachers across eleven provinces of the country. My primary assignment was to review
an English translation of sessions as they were produced and to make technical edits which
facilitated the flow and focus without losing the voice and intent of the Afghan authors.
The site staff included three translators and three Provincial Monitoring Officers
(PMO's) who had been diverted from training in the field in order to work on the RPM. The
PMO's played an important role in facilitating the whole project and in helping the AFT team to
positively influence the process. They were knowledgeable about pedagogical theories, teacher
training, and the needs of teachers in the field. We had regular daily conversations about teacher
and trainer needs and how to meet them. The PMO's then shared these ideas with the RPM
groups. Before sessions were translated into English for my review, the PMO's also reviewed,
edited and discussed the material with the drafting groups. This nuanced intervention by the
PMO's substantially improved the quality of the initial drafts.
In addition to editing, I was encouraged to monitor the drafting work and interact with
RPM participants. It soon became clear that Afghan teachers in the field needed low-prep, low-
resource ideas for encouraging active student learning. I made several short presentations to the
whole group on low resource teaching tools, such as two sheets of paper folded over into a four-
section flipbook. This becomes a handy organizer of information for students and teachers alike.
The PMO's helped to connect the ideas in my presentations to the specific interests of the
audience.
The AFT team's experience as working teachers and professional developers was
valuable in facilitating the RPM at several key points. For example, we were able to apply our
experience in coordinating the activities and output of large groups of teachers. We created
graphic organizers which listed all the modules/sessions to be produced so that each stage of
production could be monitored easily. This helped the groups to establish and maintain a pace of

work which led to the completion of all of their training materials on schedule. We were also
able to suggest practices, such as deliberate labeling of the teaching strategy and grouping for
each activity, which helped to produce higher quality drafts.
A great challenge to the production of effective training manuals was that they would
have to survive a "cascade" of at least three levels of turnkey training while retaining clarity and
effectiveness for final delivery to the often under-prepared, under-resourced, teachers in the
field. The training process had to build the skills of teachers, deepen their content knowledge,
and establish a foundation for ongoing professional collaboration at the school level. Moreover,
the teachers in the field, at least, would not be paid for attending the trainings, so the training
materials had to be coherent and speak to their immediate needs. One of the most important
AFT team contributions was to address these challenges by refining the five training sessions for
each subject into templates with standardized formats and language. The templates respected the
language and content choices of the Afghan drafters, but also helped to ensure that the training
could be executed effectively by moderately skilled trainers.
When my colleagues Betty Harris (ABC California) and Amber Prentice (St. Paul)
arrived in late August, the ground had been prepared for our team to complete the technical
editing of the Grades 4-6 RPM materials on schedule, to present appropriate teacher training
ideas to an audience of RPM participants and other Teacher Education Department officials, and
to consult constructively with the PMO's and NGO partners of Creative regarding the plans for
the implementation of the training materials.
Comments
o An earlier arrival would have helped the AFT team to make more strategic contributions
to the process, such as deepening participants' understanding of group learning activities
before they started drafting them.
o It was an advantage to send one member of the AFT team ahead in order to get a feel for
the project and prepare the ground for the rest of the team.
o Close interaction with Afghan educators helped us to discern some important issues.
These included the importance of recruiting and supporting first grade teachers, who are
often the first contact with formal education for children and their families, especially in
towns and villages. We also learned that there is a high dropout rate during Grades 4 to
6. It emerged that there is substantial variation in attitudes toward education in different
regions of the country, where local experience and tradition exert such powerful
influences.
• Language barriers, despite the help of translators, inhibited the kind of nuanced group
facilitation in which AFT/Teacher Center trainers are skilled.
o Helping to refine the flow of the twelve-day trainings is where our AFT experience and
skills would be especially valuable. We expected that Amber would be involved in this
for much of September, but there were apparently some delays.
o Some delays were undoubtedly due to the difficulties of retranslation of our edited
sessions back into Dani and Pashtu. The similar format and language of the edited
sessions was expected to save time in translation after the first example was complete,
but apparently this did not flow as smoothly as we had hoped.

Collaboration with Creative Associates
I was profoundly impressed by the qualities of the local Afghan staff who work with the
U.S. contractor Creative Associates. They are serious people. In particular, the three Provincial
Monitoring Officers who worked on the RPM project demonstrated real depth of knowledge
about pedagogy, understanding of effective practices of professional development, and
familiarity with conditions in the field which are likely to influence the effectiveness of the RPM
training materials. The ancillary staff (translators and typists) were sometimes inconsistent in
their attendance and in the volume of their work. However, they always cheerfully helped with
presentations and facilitated interactions with non-English speakers.
Comments
o Better communication before our arrival would have facilitated better decisions about
what materials to bring and helped us to plan ahead in order to utilize most fully the skills
and experience of the AFT team.
O The practice of regular reporting to the COP and at staff meetings helped us to ensure that
the priorities, pace and quality of work were consistent with expectations.
o There was some confusion in working with the Afghan translators. They were cheerful
and professional, but it was difficult accurately to assess the efficiency of their work as
they translated the RPM materials back into Dan and Pashtu.
Living and Working Conditions
Accomodation at Creative's "Green House" residence in Kabul was comfortable but not
lavish. The rooms were air-conditioned (a necessity) and mine had its own bath. Local staff
cooked excellent meals took care of the rooms and our laundry. On a couple of occasions, we
were able to entertain people to meals. It certainly felt safe, since the gates were secured by
guards around the clock and the deputy security manager lived in.
For most of August, there were strict restrictions on movement. Even a short walk down
the street to the Creative main office involved half a dozen of the security staff. It was easy to
arrange with the security manager for outings in the evening to guarded restaurants which
catered to foreigners and for visits to the grocery store and certain secure shops. Tourist
activities such as strolling through the bazaar or along the main streets were not possible. After
Betty and Amber arrived, we were able to visit the National Museum (with evidence of multiple
lootings still visible) and the palace of the former Kings. The latter was an engrossing though
eerie experience — in many ways a symbol of all the havoc wrought upon Afghanistan by a
generation of war.
Conditions out at the teacher training site were rather more challenging. Although
traveling in an armored vehicle, we were often stuck in traffic jams and the trip sometimes took
upwards of forty-five minutes. The site was a spacious classroom in the middle of the Kabul
Teachers' College campus. There were crowds of students everywhere, but one of the Creative
security staff was always on duty at the door, while the car remained just outside throughout the
day. Until the election lockdown began in mid-August, we were out at the RPM site five and a
half days a week. The workday generally ran from 8:30 to about 3:30. We seldom moved from

the room until leaving at the end of the day. During one week the heat regularly reached 110
degrees. There were electric fans and water coolers, but the flies and dust steadily swirling
through the open windows were hard on the people and computer equipment alike. When
working at the Creative main office, we were given our own desk space.
Comments
• Living conditions might seem a bit spartan to person attached to the comforts of home or
a hotel.
• Working conditions out at the Sayyed Jumalladin Teacher College site would be difficult
for a person unaccustomed to heat, dust, flies and minimal amenities.
• All movement outside of the residences is tightly controlled. One cannot stroll around
the neighborhood.
• On several occasions, we were conscious of gunfire and explosions in the general
vicinity. A person who felt especially nervous about random rockets at night or
explosions on the streets during the day would have found this mission difficult.
• Social life in Kabul exists, but is restricted by security considerations.
Assessment
This summer's collaboration in Afghanistan between the AFT and Ministry of Education
was a remarkable success. The skills and experience of the AFT team were well matched to the
needs of the BESST project. We shared in common with the Afghan educators so many similar
concerns about the training and support of teachers that it was it was easy to step in and support
the production of training manuals. The Provincial Monitoring Officers were remarkably
effective in helping us to understand and respond to the needs of Afghan teachers. The Creative
team in Kabul were practical, open-minded, and welcomed our participation in the project. Our
full AFT team of three persons, although only together for a week, was able to collaborate
frankly and efficiently from the start. Our primary tasks — supporting the rapid production by
Afghan educators of teacher training materials and preparing the Grades 4-6 manual for
publication — were completed on time and to a high standard of quality. The project could not
have been more serious. Our AFT Team, in my opinion, made a substantive contribution to the
idea that Afghan teachers can be a community of educators.
This was a marvellous professional experience. It has convinced me that if Americans
listen carefully and lead pragmatically, we can help Afghans to build a professional community
of educators which could be a sturdy foundation for civil society. The AFT, with our tradition of
practical support in response to the needs of teachers in the classroom, can fill an essential role in
the process.
Recommendations for the AFT in responding to the needs of educators in Afganistan
• Train Afghan educators in the use of low-prep, low-resource dependent strategies for
supporting active student learning, including graphic organizers and paper manipulatives;
• Share and support practices for developing reading materials which are both
developmentally and culturally appropriate, such as collections of stories about local
families, occupations, traditions, and history;

• Share experience and help develop techniques for handling large classes (sometimes of
100 students or more), especially in the early grades;
• Share experience in effective instructional planning and execution under circumstances
where the school day, school year, and student attendance are not consistent;
• Help Afghan Teacher Education Department officials and the teachers whom they train
and monitor to understand the value of formative assessments in monitoring student
learning, especially with regard to proficiency in reading and writing;
• Provide training in Curriculum Mapping and strategies for sustaining the practice so that
Afghan educators are enabled to coordinate their efforts among subjects, grade levels and
schools;
• Disseminate aspects of brain research with immediate, obvious application to instruction,
such as how the link between age and the length of attention span can inform lesson
planning;
• Support more efficient planning and instruction by teachers in the field by providing
templates, strategies for setting priorities, and techniques for self-evaluation;
• At the policy level, in training for school leaders, and in training for teachers, present a
paradigm of differentiated instruction which synthesizes common sense experience with
theories of learning into an agenda for sustained improvement of teaching and learning.
In support of this objective, I would recommend translating and adapting Judy Dodge's
Differentiation in Action and 25 Short Formative Assessments. These ideas are
digestible in small bites by teachers with limited resources;
• Support the expansion and refinement of Teacher Learning Circles (school-based
professional groups);
• Introduce and support effective practices for organizing, mobilizing, and sustaining
structures for local collaboration, such as Teacher Learning Circles, Lead Teachers,
community sponsorship of school activities, and provincial/district resource centers;
• Share experience in techniques for building connects between schools and parents;
• Help to develop a plan for teacher induction, development and retention;
• Share experience in developing supports for 1st Grade teachers, who play a critical role in
Afghanistan as the first point of contact with formal education for many children and
their parents;
• Help Afghan educators to widen the area of common language, experience and
benchmarks for proficiency in the teaching profession;
• Through training of administrators, lead teachers, and instructional specialists, facilitate
supportive school supervision and provincial leadership;
• Support analysis of the high drop-out rate in Grades 4-6 and help to develop strategic
responses so that more children move on to middle and high school;
• Share low-cost but effective practices for acknowledging and encouraging professional
accomplishment by teachers;
• Share techniques for building professional connections among teachers across provincial
boundaries. (The current set-up seems to be of the hub and spokes variety, with national
TED in Kabul at the hub, provincial TED's at the end of the spokes, and very little
reciprocal communication even between the national and provincial administrative
centers);

Dear Hillary,
Spoke to the person you recommended on Friday. Sounds like he is comfortable and even surprised that Pakistanis are
doing more. And maybe he will find some more ways to help, like the helicopter leasing. When I mentioned that
someone deep in the ISI must be happy that Al Qaeda's alive, so we don't abandon Pakistan again, he chuckled.
I talked about the "vetting" for intelligence. I also talked "defeat strategy," and the need for something more than just
deploying more forces and hoping the training for the Afghans will work.
I continue to be struck by the parallels to Vietnam, and especially Johnson's inability to resist escalation, and his
advisor's continued "incrementalism."
But I'm encouraged by the pace of the review. Seems that there's sufficient time to consider this from all angles.
I can imagine there are those arguing that we just need to fill the gap while we enlarge the Afghan army. That we help
the Pakistanis but not press them to the point of being unpleasant. And that too much focus on Osama and al-Zawahiri
raises the risk of public failure if we don't get them. There is much logic to this, but it has a strong tint of incrementalism.
Hopefully, we can be more decisive: lean harder on the Pakistanis, provide more troops to McChrystal than his
"moderate risk" and raise the heat on al Qaeda - then do all we can to push economic development in Afghanistan,
restrain Indian meddling, and prepare to do more against Al Qaeda in Pakistan, directly if necessary. Ultimately, it
seems that our best exit strategy would be to take down the top leadership of Al Qaeda in Pakistan, and then gradually
draw down in Afghanistan.
Wish I could do more to help
All the best,

Gordon Brown lost the sight in one eye in a childhood rugby injury Photo: PA Mr Brown visited Moorfields in London,
one of the world's best-known eye hospitals, after surgeons found two small tears in his retina.
The disclosure comes just two weeks after Labour Party chiefs were angry with the BBC because Andrew Marr, the
presenter, questioned the Prime Minister about his health, including his eyesight, during an interview.

Mr20Marr asked Mr Brown if he has been taking prescription drugs after rumours spread on the internet that he was
dependant on painkillers or antidepressants.
Mr Brown talked on the programme about losing the sight in one eye following a boyhood rugby. "I then had exactly the
same thing happen in my second eye. I had the same retinal detachment. I had the same fear that therefore I might lose
my sight in that eye," he admitted.
In a carefully-worded statement, No 10 said today: "This summer Mr Brown had his annual eye check-up which was fine.
Later he had his retina checked.
"After examinations, surgeons found that the retina had two minor tears. However, as there has been no further
deterioration, and no change in his eye sight, they decided against further operations. Yesterday [Friday] Mr Brown
visited Moorfields Hospital as part of regular c hecks on his eyes and this check was also fine.
"Mr Brown wants to thank the doctors and staff of the NHS particularly Moorfields Hospital. Were there to be any
change, he would of course make a further statement."
After the Andrew Marr Show late last month, senior Labour officials accused the BBC of smearing the Prime Minister.
However, the BBC defended the tactics and a spokesman said: "Andrew was asking a legitimate question about the
health of the leader of the country." The spokesman refused to be drawn on whether Mr Marr and Barney Jones, the
editor of the programme, had consulted executives at the BBC before deciding to ask Mr Brown whether he was taking
prescription medication.
Later Lord Mandelson, the Business Secretary, said it was "absolutely ridiculous" to suggest the Mr Brown had a
problem with pill use, and he blamed politically motivated bloggers for raising the possibility.
"We have seen out there on the internet, the blogosphere, all these extreme right-wing people trying to put these
smears and rumours about, all completely groundless," Lord Mandelson told GMTV. The BBC received more than 100
complaints about Mr Marr's line of questioning on the day the show was broadcast.

• ARKADELPHIA — Johnnie Mae Walker Spargo was born on the first day of Spring, March 20, 1919, and from that
day until her last on this earth, Nov. 8, 2009, she cast her beautiful blue eyes and dimpled smile on all of those around
her.
Johnnie Mae was the youngest daughter of Garland Lee and Nettie Mann Walker of Red Oak, Arkansas, now part of Hot
Springs on the southeast shores of Lake Hamilton. She was predeceased by her parents and siblings, Claude, Eddie,
Grady, Hansel, Clara, Isli, and Doyle. She was predeceased by her loving husband of 67 years, Stephen Fowler Spargo,
and by Jamie and Billy Gibbs, her daughter and sonin-law, and her son-in-law Allen Brown DeLamar. The Spargos, natives
of Hot Springs, made Arkadelphia home when Steve joined Reynolds Aluminum Company in 1954.
Mrs. Spargo is survived by her son and daughter-in-law, Byron and Mary Lynda Spargo, of Baton Rouge, La., and her
daughters, Nancy Spargo DeLamar, of Little Rock, and Dr. Linda Spargo, of Oxford, Miss. Her grandchildren include
Megan DeLamar Schroeder and her husband, Trey, of Texarkana; Hattie Alton of Oxford, Miss.; Johni Beth Gibbs and her
fiance Jeremy Teague of Sheridan; Gwendy Clingman and her husband, Ed, of Mechanicsville, Va.; and Leslie Spargo of
Baton Rouge. Johnnie Mae was especially proud of her great-grandchildren: Frances and Eleanor Schroeder and Ryan
and Lauren Clingman.
She was a fierce and loyal advocate for each and every one of her offspring and truly believed that they could be
anything in the world they wanted to be. She was a member of the First Methodist Church in Arkadelphia. Johnnie Mae
was a pre-school teacher for many years at Margo Nelson's Wonderland School in Arkadelphia. She also helped her
community as a constant and reliable election poll worker. Even though Johnnie Mae was determined that she not be
perceived as a retiring little granny, her family was her universe. She was a strong, vibrant woman with black hair coiffed
on top of her head and clicking high heels, and she had beautiful skin that all of her progeny hope to inherit. She
believed in living to the fullest until the end, doing good works, helping all whom she encountered in ways that she
could, and imbuing her children and grandchildren with a strong work ethic and deep empathy for those less fortunate.
Many people in Arkansas have been the recipient of one of her lemon butter pound cakes for doing something kind for
one of her girls. When she won the 2003 Clark County Democrat of the Year, Johnnie Mae was described as a cross
between Eva Peron and Mary Poppins.
Johnnie Mae made her mark on Arkadelphia, determined that her children would enjoy to the fullest the experiences
that the Norman Rockwellian setting provided. She threw herself into any endeavor that her children and grandchildren
wanted to pursue. When Becky Fuller, now Rebecca Ward, was the first person from the city to win a statewide election
at Girl's State, Johnnie Mae organized a city-wide homecoming celebration complete with a parade for all the
Arkadelphia delegates that included her daughter Nancy. When Johnnie Mae's daughter Jamie wanted to pursue rodeo
and barrel racing, Nonnie perfected her ability to sew cowgirl outfits while also cheering-on her daughter from the
stands. When her daughter Linda wanted to serve as a cheerleader for Arkadelphia High School and then Ouachita
Baptist University, Johnnie Mae and Steve's house became nerve-center for all events athletic. When daughter Nancy
returned to Arkadelphia in 1964 with seven-month-old Megan to raise, Johnnie and Steve provided a nurturing, loving
home for daughter and granddaughter. Megan was the grandchild who gave Johnnie Mae her proudest title: Johnnie
Mae became "Nonnie."
Nonnie was queen of a tribe of three generations of women known as "Spargo Girls." When her great-granddaughters
Frances and Eleanor were born in 1999, Nonnie was determined that the twin girls would not use an exclusive
communication method. Nonnie's special task was to talk with them extensively and one-on-one, making sure that the

UNCLASSIFIED U.S. Department of State Case No. F-2014-20439 Doc No. C05760369 Date: 06/30/2015
girls' first desire was to talk to her. Active in Democratic politics at all levels and with a passion, she was equally a
dedicated life master of duplicate bridge and played many a set with her friends at the House of Bridge in Hot Springs.
Johnnie ultimately spent most of her time driving to wherever one of her children lived to help with whatever tasks of
life needed tending. In response to this demanding schedule, she famously responded, "You can sleep when you are
dead!" Her stock question when confronted with news from one of her children of a pending event — whether one was
receiving an award or going out for lunch — was "Well, what will you wear?" Raising all these Spargo girls, she was
expert not only at re-upholstering an entire set of living room furniture, she also sewed countless, spontaneous-yet-
appropriate attire, from couture evening gowns to cowgirl wear. Making ball gowns from the draperies was not
exclusive to other southern heroines.
Perhaps Johnnie Mae's most endearing qualities were unfailing optimism combined with great pragmatism. She lived in
the present and did not believe in guilt or regrets. Born before women could vote, she cast one of her last votes for the
woman she hoped would be the first woman President. When Hillary did not prevail, she once again enjoyed casting a
vote for a straight Democratic ticket. Nonnie would want the family to express special gratitude for the many kindnesses
extended to her by the staff and nurses at Presbyterian Village in Little Rock, where she resided since June 2009. Thank
you is extended also to Arkansas Hospice whose compassion and care comforted both family and friends. Thanks are
also expressed to the staff of Home Instead and their compassionate caregiver, Bette White. John Lee Roberts of
Arkadelphia provided unwavering help and assistance and was a much loved friend and companion to both Steve and
Johnnie Mae.
The family will have a visitation at 9:30-10:30 a.m. Wednesday at Ruggles-Wilcox Funeral Home in Arkadelphia, followed
by a graveside service at 10:30 a.m. Wednesday at Rose Hill Cemetery led by Father Douglas Anderson of St. James
Episcopal Church, Texarkana. Memorials may be made to Arkansas Hospice, 5600 W 12th St., Little Rock, Ark. 72204;

Libyan Reps tell Rothman Quaddafi not coming to Englewood
FOR IMMEDIATE RELEASE: Friday, August 28, 2009 4:04 pm EST
Contact: Bob Decheine (202) 550-7869
Washington, D.C. based representatives of the Libyan government have informed Congressman Steve Rothman (D-NJ)
that Col. Moammar Quaddafi, will not be staying in Englewood, New Jersey if he comes to the United States for the
meeting of the United Nations General Assembly next month. This information has not yet been confirmed by the
White House or the State Department.
"I am very pleased that Moammar Quaddafi will apparently not be coming to Englewood. His appearance would have
presented unnecessary safety and security issues for the residents of Englewood and the Libyan diplomats," said
Rothman. I want to thank President Barack Obama and Secretary of State Hillary Clinton and the literally dozens of their
appointees I have had the pleasure to work so closely with over the past seven days in achieving this result. I also want
to thank the Libyan government for their hard work and consideration in resolving this matter in such a positive
fashion."

Colleagues
On the assumption that the Department is ready to take the position that we will not permit him to use the NJ property,
recommend the following after consultations with the lawyers and experts who handle our "hostship" responsibilities
The Department of State has consulted with the Government of Libya regarding the impending visit of
Libyan President Muammar Qadhafi to
attend the General Assembly of the United Nations in New York.
In keeping with prior arrangements, the Englewood, New Jersey property is not available for any use in connection
with the upcoming visit
I don't think that we want/need to get into particulars about boroughs within NYC

Team — we really need something to go out today regarding Qadahfi's visit to the UNGA. There is a rally in NJ planned
for Sunday morning — that rally is growing in scope and impact as the time passes. The Congressional interest and
concern is also growing stronger. I would propose a statement from PJ, along the lines of the one below, but am open

As far as Afghanistan goes, we still do not know if a budget amendment will be going up next week or not. We should
know by Monday morning. Our staff has been asked to prepare a template without numbers so a decision could be
implemented quickly. I am confident that there will be time to have a discussion both at the highest levels at OMB and
the WH before this is locked. As far as the 2011 budget goes, we should hear back at least from staff early next week and
I will reach out to Peter and Rob to start a discussion at the top line level. I think we will want you to enagage some time
this coming week, but I would like to see what the real gap is first.

Dear Cheryl and Jake,
I wanted to let you know that after a great deal of soul-searching, I have decided to leave the State Department in about
a month.
This was an exceptionally difficult decision; one of the most difficult I have made in my life. It has been a honor and a
real joy to have been part of the team here at State; the past year has been one of the most enriching experiences of my
career. I am leaving only for personal reasons; after pushing myself as hard as I possibly could the last several years, I
need to do this for myself, to spend some time away from work with my family and friends and reenergize.
Thank you once again for the remarkable opportunity to serve our country and work for the Secretary. This has been a
rare privilege, and I cannot stress enough how appreciative I am. I hold the entire team here in the highest possible
regard.

Dear All,
After this morning's meeting, L undertook more research
Millennium Challenge Report
The Millennium Challenge Act of 2003 requires the submission of a report to Congress and publication in the Federal
Register of a list of countries that are candidate countries for MCC assistance, and countries that would be candidate
countries but for "specified legal prohibitions on assistance." Honduras is a candidate country. If Honduras is subject to
the restrictions in section 7008, it would be listed in that section of the report that identifies countries that would be

UNCLASSIFIED U.S. Department of State Case No. F-2014-20439 Doc No. C05760400 Date: 06/30/2015
candidate countries but for legal prohibitions that prohibit assistance. The report would also provide an explanation of
the legal prohibition (in fact, other coup restricted countries, such as Cote d'Ivoire, Madagascar, Mauritania, and Sudan,
are on the prohibited list and section 7008 is explicitly mentioned).
The list must be approved by the Board of the MCC, of which the Secretary is the chair, and is due on 9/10. It is our
understanding that an action memo will be presented to the Secretary, perhaps as early as next week, so that she can
approve submission of the report. The action memo will require the Secretary to decide whether Honduras is a country
without a "specified legal prohibition" or whether such a prohibition has in fact attached.
Department Legal Practice
I am travelling in New England this weekend but am available at or through the ops center if you wish to
discuss. I will be back by the 8:45am meeting on Monday morning and can elaborate further then.
Section 7008 of the Department of State, Foreign Operations, and Related Programs Appropriations Act, 2009 (Div. H,
P.L. 111-8) provides:
"None of the funds appropriated or otherwise made available pursuant to titles III through VI of this Act shall be
obligated or expended to finance directly any assistance to the government of any country whose duly elected head of
government is deposed by military coup or decree: Provided, That assistance may be resumed to such government if the
President determined and certifies to the Committees on Appropriations that subsequent to the termination of
assistance a democratically elected government has taken office: Provided further, That the provisions of this section
shall not apply to assistance to promote democratic elections or public participation in democratic processes: Provided

And I hope you're working on the democracy/human rights speech I'm giving the week of the 7th. Are you?

We've sent word that she's going to call (I think Davu is in Slovenia but should be available). I think we've got
agreement on the text after another word change or two, and Davu will know that the key issue is agreeing on a date for
a signing and submission to parliaments. We've told the Turks that it "should be" in early October. They will push back,
and if they agree to a date at all it will probably be Oct 12. That will be much harder to sell to other side, but our
minimum need is a date at least by then. Thanks.

Huma:
For the Davutoglu call, here is a copy of the text the Turks (Davutoglu) have agreed to release tomorrow, if the
Armenians agree. And as noted in the call sheet, they will only agree if Turkey agrees on a date in advance of Oct. 14 for
the signature of the documents. Let me know if any questions.

We've sent word that she's going to call (I think Davu is in Slovenia but should be available). I think we've got
agreement on the text after another word change or two, and Davu will know that the key issue is agreeing on a date for
a signing and submission to parliaments. We've told the Turks that it "should be" in early October. They will push back,
and if they agree to a date at all it will probably be Oct 12. That will be much harder to sell to other side, but our
minimum need is a date at least by then. Thanks.

Stewart,
I went for news and indeed Guy is right. The meeting occurred yesterday and the decision was made to revoke the
government on October 29. I wonder what happened with the initial decision which was strictly concerning Minister
Dorsainvil and which was for November 20th or 21st.The idea had been sold that Michele should not be touched as the
President did not care to have a vacuum in these electoral times. Plus, Michele was finally regarded as ambitionless (not

seeking presidential powers) which is not a bad thing under the circumstances. Apparently, she, not being amenable to
sacrificing some of her Ministers...and again, she being the one to name their replacements, has brought about the
decision to do away with her altogether. The trouble is that nobody seems willing to counter the President with whom
the instructions have originated. It is a head to head match between the Prime Minister and the President. That is
obviously not good. Nobody will stand against the President elect for the Prime Minister appointed.
I will have two meetings with separate parliamentarians tomorrow. On one end the ones voting to oust her on the
other the week opposition. The frustrating thing is that none have allegiance to her, just as none have the individual
power to stand against the vote for which consensus is being secured.
The UN and other international players (at least locally) after having cried victory, success and democracy are reluctant
to openly and publically denounce the matter. After announcing a week or two ago that Haiti is the new place to invest,
how can they say anything but whatever is done, reflects good governance.
Frankly, I did not see this one coming. We need to think.
In touch tomorrow for updates.

I've asked Todd to identify the specific areas where he thinks progress can be made through discussions on Thursday.
At a high level, I think leaders' conversations on Thursday will begin to narrow gaps on the big issues -- transparency,
funding, inscribing commitments, etc -- IF (and it's a big if) those gaps are narrow-able. If they're not, then
Thursday/Friday will be days of trying and failing ... but at least trying.
Todd's view is that there is not enough time Friday for top-level meetings to close the deal; that two days are required.
You would be our head of delegation for the first, POTUS for the second.

Really good editorial here. Really worth reading.
This Week in Copenhagen
December 12, 2009
Editorial
We didn't expect much from the first week of the global warming conference in Copenhagen. Countries need to do a
little posturing before getting down to the hard work, which is supposed to start on Monday. But the belligerent talk
from China seemed to go well beyond the usual positioning.
The best hope is that the talks will produce an interim understanding under which industrialized countries would
commit to fairly precise targets for reduced emissions, and others, like China, to broader but measurable goals. The
industrial countries would be expected to help poorer countries shift to less-polluting forms of energy.
That would set the stage for a legally binding deal in 2010. But there is no chance of even an interim agreement without
the enthusiastic participation of China, the biggest emitter of greenhouse gases. China's absence would give other
developing countries — and the United States Senate — an excuse to do less than needed.
Beijing's recent pledge to slow the growth in emissions seemed like a positive shift in attitude. Then on Tuesday, in a
surprising show of defensiveness, China's top negotiator, Su Wei, said the greatest burden rested with the industrialized
countries and jumped on the United States, Japan and the European Union for not being aggressive enough. Another
Chinese official urged Washington to do "some deep soul-searching" and improve its proposal.
Todd Stern, the chief American negotiator, responded correctly: With emissions in many industrialized countries peaking
or declining, just about all of the growth in greenhouse gases is expected to come from the developing world between
now and 2030, half from China. Rich nations must still reduce emissions sharply, Mr. Stern said, but "there is no way to
solve this problem by giving the major developing countries a pass."
UNCLASSIFIED U.S. Department of State Case No. F-2014-20439 Doc No. C05761222 Date: 06/30/2015
UNCLASSIFIED U.S. Department of State Case No. F-2014-20439 Doc No. C05761222 Date: 06/30/2015
China has also been demanding that rich nations contribute hundreds of millions of dollars a year to help poor countries
address the threat of climate change. Again Mr. Stern was blunt. Washington is prepared to help those who need it, but
given China's huge reserves and revved-up economy, he said he could not envision "public funds, certainly not from the
United States, going to China."
The most positive development has been a pledge by the European Union to contribute $10.5 billion over the next three
years to help poorer countries deal with climate change. The United States has said that it will make a contribution but
has not said how big it will be.
Transparency is another difficult issue that must be resolved, at least in principle, this week. There is no point in setting
targets, or threatening penalties for noncompliance, unless countries are required to report emissions accurately.
Transparency has never been one of Beijing's virtues, and emerging countries generally need aid to create sophisticated
monitoring systems.
Copenhagen's broadest challenge is finding an equitable way to distribute the burden of confronting climate change.
Despite some differences, the industrialized nations have pretty much agreed to trim their emissions by 15 percent to 20
percent from 2005 levels in the next 10 years, and by 80 percent by midcentury. And all seem to be willing to make
expensive investments to get there. President Obama will need help from Congress, no sure thing.
A host of developing countries — including India, Brazil, Indonesia — have put broad goals on the table, though in some
cases they seem more aspirational than real. But the bottom line is that the hope for a meaningful deal is vanishingly
small if China doesn't sign on.

Obama envoy: Time to act on climate change By ARTHUR MAX –2 hours ago
BONN, Germany (AP) — Once booed at international climate talks, the United States won sustained applause Sunday
when President Barack Obama's envoy pledged to "make up for lost time" in reaching a global agreement on climate
change.
Todd Stern also praised efforts by countries like China to reign in their carbon emissions, but said global warming
"requires a global response" and that rapidly developing economies like China "must join together" with the industrial
world to solve the problem.
The debut of Obama's climate change team was widely anticipated after eight years of obdurate participation in U.N.
climate talks by the previous Bush administration.
"We are very glad to be back. We want to make up for lost time, and we are seized with the urgency of the task before
us," Stern said to loud applause from the 2,600 delegates to the U.N. negotiations.
They clapped again when Stern said the U.S. recognized "our unique responsibility ... as the largest historic emitter of
greenhouse gases," which has created a problem threatening the entire world.
The two-week meeting by 175 countries that began Sunday was the latest stage of talks aimed at forging a climate
change agreement to replace the 1997 Kyoto Protocol on emissions targets for rich countries, which expires in 2012.

UNCLASSIFIED U.S. Department of State Case No. F-2014-20439 Doc No. C05761448 Date: 06/30/2015
The United States was instrumental in negotiating Kyoto, but failed to win support at home. When George W. Bush took
office, he renounced it, calling Kyoto a flawed agreement that would harm the U.S. economy and unfair because it
demanded nothing from countries like China or India.
Stern said his team did not want a repeat of the Kyoto debacle. The latest agreement is due to be finalized in December
in Copenhagen, Denmark.
"Ultimately, this is a political process," he said. "The way forward is steered by science and pragmatism."
Stern said no one on his team doubted that climate change is real. "The science is clear, the threat is real, the facts on
the ground are outstripping the worst-case scenarios. The cost of inaction or inadequate action are unacceptable," he
said — a total change of tone from his predecessors.
Scientists warned recently that climate change is happening more rapidly that previously calculated and said the Earth
could be in danger of major climatic changes that would trigger widespread social disruption. U.N. scientists say rising
sea levels caused by global warming threatens to swamp coastlines and entire island states, and predicted increasing
drought for arid countries, especially in Africa.
Obama has set aside $80 billion in his economic stimulus package for green energy, promised $150 billion for research
over 10 years, and was tightening regulations on auto emissions, Stern said.
"America itself cannot provide the solution, but there is no solution without America," he said.
"It sent chills up my spine seeing the U.S. applauded," Keya Chatterjee of the Worldwide Fund for Nature said after
Stern's speech.
It was only 15 months ago at Bali, Indonesia, that U.S. negotiators were booed when they threatened to veto an accord
laying down a two-year negotiating process to replace Kyoto. They backed off when the delegate from Papua New
Guinea, Kevin Conrad, told them if "you are not willing to lead ... please get out of the way."
Stern urged delegates Sunday to adopt a long-range vision for reducing climate change, rather than to focus on "a series
of short-term, stopgap measures," and repeated Obama's determination to cut emissions by 80 percent by mid-century.
His speech was meant to shift the debate from persistent demands by developing countries for industrial nations to
reduce emissions by 25-40 percent below 1990 levels by 2020. Stern has said previously that goal was unattainable for
the U.S.
Speaking earlier to reporters, Stern defended the U.S. administration's goal of reducing U.S. carbon emissions by roughly
16 percent over the next dozen years from current levels.
"We don't think (the target) is low at all," he said, adding it was "consistent with what other countries are willing to do."
Others disagreed.
"The target that the United States has put forward is not going to be sufficient," said Chatterjee.
Jake Schmidt of the Nature Resources Defense Council said the Obama administration was talking behind the scenes
about setting an annual emissions reduction target leading up to 2050.
"It's hard to turn a big ship around, but it would show we are serious about our commitments to cut emissions from the
medium to the long term," Schmidt said.

With time running out before the pact is due to be completed in December, delegates are trying to narrow vast
differences over how best to fight climate change.
Issues include how much countries need to reduce emissions, how to raise the tens of billions of dollars needed annually
to fight global warming and how to transfer money and technology to poor countries who are most vulnerable to
increasingly fierce storms, droughts and failing crops.
Stern said the U.S. position will be guided by whatever deal Obama can strike with Congress.
"I do not think that it is realistic to believe that we will then be able to go into an international setting and get a higher
number than that," he said.

US to push for UN climate deal but no "magic wand"
Sun Mar 29, 2009 11:04am EDT
* Obama to push for new climate treaty
* Climate envoy says no magic wand, sets limits to U.S. cuts
(Adds details, quotes)
By Alister Doyle, Environment Correspondent
BONN, Germany, March 29 (Reuters) - U.S. President Barack Obama's administration promised to push for a new global
treaty to fight global warming at United Nations climate talks on Sunday but cautioned it had no magic wand.
"The United States is going to be powerfully and fully engaged," U.S. special envoy for climate change Todd Stern said at
the opening of 175-nation U.N. talks in Bonn.
"But we are all going to have to do this together, we don't have a magic wand," he told a news conference at the March
29-April 8 meeting in Bonn, the first since Obama took office. The U.S. delegation was greeted by applause at the
opening.
Stern said the United States wanted to work for a treaty that was economically "doable" and that countries could not
expect Washington to "ride in on a white horse" to solve the problem. "We can't," he said.
Some nations, racked by recession, have been waiting to hear Obama's policies before unveiling their own. The Bonn
talks are due to consider issues including the levels of greenhouse gas cuts needed to slow global warming.
Obama has promised to cut U.S. greenhouse gas emissions by about 16-17 percent from current levels to take them
back to 1990 levels by 2020 as part of a new U.N. climate deal meant to be agreed in Copenhagen in December.
Under former President George W. Bush, the United States was isolated among industrialised nations in opposing caps
on emissions under the U.N.'s existing Kyoto Protocol. Delegates even booed U.S. delegates at a meeting in Indonesia, in
2007.

"Everyone is very excited" by signs of a stronger U.S. commitment, Yvo de Boer, head of the U.N. Climate Change
Secretariat, told a news conference. China and the United States are the top greenhouse gas emitters.
NO WHITE HORSE
Stern said, however, that the United States could not make the deepest cuts in greenhouse gases advised by the U.N.
Climate Panel for 2020 to avoid the worst of global warming, of between 25 and 40 percent below 1990 levels.
"We should be guided by a combination of science and Pragmatism," Stern said. Many developing nations, led by China,
want rich nations to make deep cuts.
Almost no developed nations have laid out goals within the 25-40 percent range. Among the most ambitious, the
European Union plans cuts of 20 percent below 1990 levels by 2020.
The U.N. Climate Panel projects more floods, droughts, more powerful storms, heatwaves and rising sea levels from a
gradual build-up of heat-trapping gases from burning fossil fuels.
De Boer has in the past called Obama's goals an "opening offer" that he hopes will be toughened in Copenhagen.
Stern said that it was unclear whether Congress will manage to pass climate legislation before the Copenhagen meeting
in December. If a law is passed by then, he said, it would be unrealistic for Washington to sign up to any tougher cuts.
On Saturday, an estimated one billion people turned out the lights for an Earth Hour to show concern about global
warming. The action also dimmed landmarks from the Eiffel Tower to the Sydney Harbour Bridge.
"Earth hour was probably the largest public demonstration on climate change ever," de Boer said.

RELEASE IN FULL
Mr/s Chairman, Members of the Commission, Thank you for the invitation to speak
today on this timely subject.
My testimony will address how Chinese foreign-directed information operations figure
into the People's Republic of China's (PRC's) broader strategy as it rises, and my
remarks will be structured around what the Chinese themselves are saying and writing
about foreign-directed information operations in their internal reports. After reviewing a
representative sample of the Chinese reports, I'll move to the logic behind their approach,
or where it comes from, and finally, what China's aims are, before offering a preliminary
assessment of their success. To give you a preview, my answer is, clearly, yes, the
Chinese Communist Party (CCP) leadership is trying to influence or shape American
perceptions of, and policies toward, China. Mainly, up to now, these efforts have been in
the direction of reassurance, to allay US concerns about China's economic rise, military
build-up, and increasing political and diplomatic influence.
Let me begin by referring to a Chinese report addressing the need for, and character of,
foreign-directed strategic information capabilities. This article, a kind of roadmap for
foreign-directed information campaigns, appeared in a February 2009 Reference News
(Cankao Xiaoxi) outlet, and it was translated by the American Open Source Center, along
with the other articles that I am going to cite today. Reference News publications come
out of a special branch of the official Chinese news agency Xinhua that is charged with
preparing information and analysis for senior cadres. In theory, the circulation of these
Reference News reports is limited to high-ranking Party members. To be sure, I am not
about to quote a policy document but rather an analytical piece. It seems to be
representative of a certain cast of mind, however, as we will see. The article from
February refers to "national public relations weapons," which it defines: "By national
public relations, we mean dialogues between nations or between a country and relevant
stake holders against the backdrop of competition over power and interest."
The need to "set the agenda for foreign media" is explicitly stressed. Under a subhead of
the article called "Media Diplomacy: Breaking the Siege of Public Opinion in the West,"
the author writes:
It is obvious that the West still has the upper hand while the East remains weak...
Whenever there is an agenda dispute, international public opinion will form a force
that involves the West's besieging the East.
And the article proceeds to explain:
Influencing and setting the foreign media agenda fully embodies a rule of the game
in modern society — that is, whoever can influence the media agenda can influence
the public agenda... The foreign media are not a taxi on the road that can be flagged
when one needs it and shoved away when one does not need it.
In other words, the foreign press has to be cultivated, so that when a crisis strikes, certain
outlets can be counted upon to report favorably on China.
UNCLASSIFIED U.S. Department of State Case No. F-2014-20439 Doc No. C05761506 Date: 06/30/2015
UNCLASSIFIED U.S. Department of State Case No. F-2014-20439 Doc No. C05761506 Date: 06/30/2015
How can this be achieved? "Foreign media outlets should be given special treatment so
that they will not be forced to unite and form a confrontational alliance." In other words,
divide them, or keep them divided. The article elaborates on this question, emphasizing
the need to "provide them with specialized information..." That is, grant privileges to
encourage positive coverage.
Under the same heading of "Breaking the Siege of Public Opinion in the West," the
article also offers general precepts such as,
When a negative event occurs, [the authorities] should not order the media to shut up.
Public opinion is like a big container. The more information you inject.., the less
space there is for other people's views and ability to return fire.
In other words, flood the zone.
More specifically, under the heading of "Lobbying," the author writes:
We need to influence the influential. In every country, there are famous
commentators and writers, and they are the media and public focus. With the
support of these foreign 'eloquent speakers' and writers, the national public relations
drive can yield twice the results with half the effort. In addition, it is necessary to
fully mobilize overseas elites and [overseas] Chinese who are 'familiar with
China.' ... [Because they] understand the cultural environment abroad, they can be
good assistants in China's public relations.
Where does all this come from? Whence this talk of a "siege of public opinion," "national
public relations weapons," and the like? It flows from a tradition that stresses the role of
information in political and geopolitical interactions — that is, in both domestic and
foreign strategy. I'd go so far as to say that the Chinese tradition puts managing
perceptions at the heart of strategy. This is evident from Sun Zi's injunction to know the
enemy and oneself to the CCP's extensive domestic propaganda and information
management efforts, which have been explored by scholars such as Anne-Marie Brady,
David Shambaugh, Daniel Lynch and Ashley Esarey, among others. Perhaps most
relevant for our purposes, the emphasis on information in China's strategic culture is
evident in Deng Xiaoping's famous injunction that China should "bide its time and hide
its capabilities," which can only be understood as a call to shape the data that reaches
foreigners, in this case to conceal certain data.
In this connection, consider the formulation designed to influence how foreigners
understand China's increased power on the world stage, "peaceful rise." The line,
promulgated by Zheng Bijian in 2002, was later changed to "peaceful development," lest
the word "rise" provoke anxiety and undermine the intended effect of reassuring
foreigners about China's trajectory. But before this change took hold, Zheng slipped up
in a September 2004 Shanghai TV appearance, as quoted in a recent China Quarterly
article by Daniel Lynch: "Working in this way [touting the "peaceful rise"] has its

advantages — in obtaining greater understanding, sympathy and support, in winning
discourse power on the question of China's development path, in winning discourse
power in the international sphere... It is all extremely advantageous, and there is
absolutely no downside." This is a pretty stunning shift from insisting that "peaceful
rise" is an earnest description of China's present and future to describing the label as
instrumental, a tool for "winning discourse power."
Now Zheng is affiliated with the Central Party School of the Chinese Communist Party,
but he has been a senior member of the Party's propaganda apparatus, an extensive
network of offices that exists behind the official bureaucracy, since the 1960s. Zheng is
never identified this way in Chinese Western-language news outlets. Further, the Party
School is often referred to as a Chinese think tank. Is this an institution just like our
Brookings or AEI? No. In another recent article called "It Is Difficult for Chinese Think
Tanks to Learn from the American Model," the author explicitly notes the differences:
"US private think tanks are in ... a thriving state. This is unique in the entire world, ... a
byproduct of ... the US dual-party election system... fundamentally different from the
domestic conditions of China." Therefore, "one is afraid that what China think tanks can
learn from US think tanks is more about micro-level management and operational
models." In other words, because most Chinese think tanks are sponsored by the Party,
while American think tanks are private, all Chinese think tanks can learn from their US
counterparts is internal organizational details.
A different recent piece, "China Must Have Strong Nongovernmental Diplomatic
Power," published in a Chinese People's Daily [Renmin Ribao] outlet that tracks foreign
opinion on China for senior cadres, reviews the fundamental differences between the
United States and China in the think tank realm, and assesses that China is at a
disadvantage:
The diversified nongovernmental forces have provided US diplomacy with multiple
abilities to set up various agendas. In the meantime, China can do nothing but rely on -
its government's single-track diplomacy. This has placed China in a passive position,
in which it is hard to cope with the situation, as if it is shooting mosquitoes with a
cannon.
The article goes on to say that to avoid embarrassments like the crackdown on free Tibet
protestors in the run-up to the Olympics, China must unleash overseas Chinese to counter
Western public expressions of sympathy for Tibet.
What is this talk of "discourse power in the international sphere" and "shooting
mosquitoes" about? Well, with regard to the United States and the lines about "biding
time, and hiding capabilities" and "peaceful rise," we can be sure that there is an effort to
keep America friendly and complacent. But there is also increasing realism in the
Chinese reports about the continuing feasibility of this approach as China passes through
different stages of modernization and development and starts to assume roles associated
with great powers.

UNCLASSIFIED U.S. Department of State Case No. F-2014-20439 Doc No. C05761506 Date: 06/30/2015
From the "national public relations" document that I quoted at the outset, here is a
description of a natural evolution for China's foreign-directed information campaigns:
China's public relations drive is not a.. .competition that involves waging a quick
battle, but what Chairman Mao.. .described as a 'long-running battle.' According to
Chairman Mao, a long-running battle involved three stages: defense, confrontation,
and counterattack. From the strategic level of national public relations, the defense
stage comprises passive defense and active defense. We divide the confrontation
period into two parts: confrontation resulting from both sides being well matched in
strength, and [then] dialogue brought about by a balance of power. The counterattack
stage involves attacking and conquering.
Within the PRC today, there seems to be significant discussion of whether China can
continue to bide its time or whether China will be compelled to shift its foreign-directed
information efforts. The roadmap article concludes, "While we should not demonstrate
toughness characteristic of the confrontation stage and the counterattack stage, we cannot
continue making the kind of unprincipled compromises or maintaining the unrestrained
modesty that marks the passive defense stage."
In addition to shifting the message directed at the United States, China may accelerate its
wooing of other countries. Perhaps inspired by the idea of "soft power," the Chinese
seem to believe that a competition exists in the realm of "international public opinion."
A January 2008 analysis by the scholar Yan Xuetong, published in a journal of the
Chinese Institute of Contemporary International Relations (CICIR), a "think tank" with
ties to the Ministry of State Security, which oversees Chinese counterintelligence, argues
that "if a country has relatively many strategically friendly countries, it is likely to win
support from other countries." According to Yan, the United States has an advantage in
allies, or "international mobilization ability," but this can be eroded in three to five years
if China properly "positions" itself or manipulates impressions of China's "identity":
We may think of repositioning China's international identity and expanding the
homogeneity between China and other countries in identity. Economically, China
may position itself as a burgeoning modern country, being between a developed and
underdeveloped country. Politically, China may position itself as a democratizing
country, ... between a democratic country and ... [an autocracy]. Culturally, China
may position itself as a Confucian country, between a religious and a nonreligious
country...
I have been talking about Chinese intentions up to now. To conclude, I would like to turn
to an assessment of effects. But effects are difficult to measure, in part because any
judgment requires addressing the counterfactual question, Would we have acted as we
have in the absence of Chinese foreign-directed information campaigns? As a
preliminary answer, let me adduce the article "Have China Scholars All Been Bought,"
by the Hong Kong-based professor Carsten Holz. Holz begins, "Academics who study
China, which includes the author, habitually please the Chinese Communist Party,
UNCLASSIFIED U.S. Department of State Case No. F-2014-20439 Doc No. C05761506 Date: 06/30/2015
UNCLASSIFIED U.S. Department of State Case No. F-2014-20439 Doc No. C05761506 Date: 06/30/2015
sometimes consciously, and often unconsciously." Consider, too, the words of one of the
most senior American scholars of China, Orville Schell:
I try to say, 'Okay, here is what I think, what I understand, what I think I see, have
learned and read.' Then, I try and think through what the Chinese government's
reaction will be... And then I try to be as truthful as I can in a way that is respectful
and unprovocative but that is not pandering. China has a tremendously highly
evolved capacity to create panderers both among its own people and foreigners who
become involved with them.
Where is all of this going if China succeeds in reassuring the United States while
increasing its "international mobilization ability"? That's a subject for a different hearing,
I think. Thank you again, and I look forward to your questions.

I spoke with Mr. Gore a second time today; I called him this afternoon after we had seen some brief wire stories appear,
referencing the KCNA report below. Explaining that this was my personal view, I said I was encouraged that the term
"espionage" did not appear in the KCNA report. I also mentioned that we were not aware of recent cases where
previously detained Amcits in the DPRK were "indicted" and "brought to trial." I said I wouldn't read too much into
terms such as "illegal entry" and "suspected hostile acts"; I was still convinced that the track we've been pursuing, i.e.
gaining consular access through the Swedish Amb. in Pyongyang, and contact via other diplomatic channels, offered
hope for a resolution.
Mr. Gore said he very much appreciated the call. He asked that we convey as much of this information as we could to
the family members. I told him we would do so through CA.

Obama picks financial backer for UK ambassador post Chicago friend Louis Susman chosen for plum posting despite
president's promise to end cronyism in Washington Ewen MacAskill in Washington Wednesday May 20 2009
guardian.co.uk
A little bit of Chicago's ruthless and combative political machine is soon to descend on the decorous calm of the Court of
St James. Despite promising to end cronyism in Washington, Barack Obama is about to appoint one of his home town
friends and financial backers to the plum posting of US ambassador to London.
The next ambassador extraordinary and plenipotentiary will be Louis Susman, a lawyer and financier with little
experience of foreign affairs.
The appointment will end months of speculation. Susman's name first surfaced in a diary column in the Washington Post
in February, but Caroline Kennedy was also mentioned, as was Oprah Winfrey, another of Obama's Chicago supporters.
There was no official confirmation of Susman's nomination today, but the Guardian has learned that the paperwork has
been completed. Buckingham Palace approved the appointment this month and Obama will announce it shortly.
London has become a retirement posting for many backers of US presidents, offering a comfortable home in one of the
best mansions in the city, Winfield House in Regent's Park.
Recent ambassadors have been political appointees more interested in country walks than Iraq or nuclear non-
proliferation. Most of the work is left to the number twos at the embassy, career diplomats.
Susman, 71, a vice-president of Citigroup until he retired in February, has long been a backer of the Democrats,
nicknamed the Vacuum Cleaner by the Chicago Tribune for his ability to hoover up campaign funding. "I don't think
anyone enjoys raising money, but for some reason I seem to have a knack," he told the paper. Susman, who lives in an
expensive neighbourhood of Chicago overlooking Lake Michigan, raised at least $500,000 (?320,000) for Obama's
campaign and a further $300,000 for his inauguration.
He is so much a part of Obama's inner circle that he was invited to an exclusive party on the Sunday before the
inauguration. Other guests included Rahm Emanuel, Obama's chief of staff, who typifies the sharp-suited, foul-mouthed
approach of those brought up on Chicago politics.
London is not the only posting being used to reward political supporters.
Other positions in Europe are expected to be filled on the basis of patronage. Dan Rooney, owner of the Pittsburgh
Steelers football team, who campaigned for Obama, is to be the ambassador to Dublin.

UNCLASSIFIED U.S. Department of State Case No. F-2014-20439 Doc No. C05761571 Date: 06/30/2015
The appointments will disappoint former US career diplomats who have been pressing Obama to end the practice,
especially since he promised to offer more of the top jobs to diplomats. In the Washington Post in December, a retired
diplomat with 30 years' service, Morton Abramowitz, called on Obama to "declare that he will not appoint ambassadors
who have secured their posts through financial contributions and who have little background to merit any such
appointment".
Ronald Neumann, a former career diplomat and ambassador and president of the Washington-based American
Academy of Diplomacy, wrote to Obama last year, saying ambassadors should have had experience of the country they
are being appointed to. Neumann said today: "You would think with our most important ally we might occasionally send
someone with some experience."
• Historically, about 25% to 30% of the diplomatic posts have been political appointees. It is too early to say, but Obama's
ratio could yet be lower.
The president's choice of Susman could be viewed as a snub to the UK. The relationship between the Obama
administration and the UK government got off to a bad start. At least one member of the administration was irritated
over the leaking during the campaign of a memo from the British ambassador, Sir Nigel Sheinwald, assessing Obama as
"aloof". But the minor rows over the memo, the removal of the Churchill bust from the Oval office, the DVD present to
Gordon Brown and other perceived slights have been presentational problems rather than a sign of ruptured relations.
Obama's predecessor, George W Bush, sent two of his financier backers to the
UK: William Farish, a Texas multimillionaire, and Robert Tuttle, a California car dealer. The lack of an experienced
diplomat in London was felt most in the runup to the war in Iraq in 2003, with Farish invisible when a figure was needed
to put the US case on camera and in print.

Because of the time difference, your clips were prepared at midnight Eastern Time so many are still early versions. But
what we're seeing online right now look MUCH better this morning than even 5 hours ago - it just took a bit for your

I'm usually the pessimist, but I'm not sure this is as dire as it seems in the moment from 10,000 miles away.
First, the world/media is fixated on the President's speech, the imagery from Riyadh dominates, there's no Honduras
footage of interest, which is key. Speech tomorrow will blanket coverage and extinguish the Cuba stuff, so we just need
to weather the night.
Second, Tom & Dan did an on the record conf call not long ago and we think they did very well. Dan was especially
strong, and he's also speaking to people 1:1
Third, your statement was strong and the reporting will catch up with it, it's only been out 90 minutes.
Fourth, we are suffering from two significant tactical problems: 1) you are here and removed 2) our press corps was out
of position today and in flight, so the people we worked on all week and the ones likely to skew our way were replaced
by reporters not connected to us.
The two issues above will be rectified tomorrow in your two interviews - especially Greta who is malleable. We can use
that to make a strong case on the principle, and the simple fact Cuba wasn't in the OAS yesterday, and won't be
tomorrow. Everyday that passes reinforces that point. The time difference to East Coast will help us in moving
whatever is said in these interviews tomorrow.
Short term, we started the week showing we can engage with Cuba (mail, migration), and ending it showing we are
serious about our redlines
Long term, we stood up for human rights and that can only be a plus.

Madam Secretary,
The text below is a blueprint for both a speech and a Foreign Affairs article. For the speech,
we will have to shorten it and add more examples, as well as put it more in your distinctive voice.
You will see lots of places where I have indicated in footnote that we need examples from what you
have done over the past four months. We also need to flesh out the smart power toolbox section —
this is a chance to roll out a lot of the innovative techniques/ideas that Alec Ross, Jared Cohen and I
have been working on with others in the building. I have asked Alec and Jared to start working on
that section already.
There are enough big ideas here to power several speeches, and perhaps too many for one
speech. You could, for instance, make this speech primarily about power and purpose — discussing
the world we are in, the strategy for expanding and using our power, and the final section on
purpose, and then give a second speech that would focus on a new opportunity for American
leadership using all the tools of smart power (with again a particular emphasis on how we can
innovate with mobile information technology). In addition, however you decide you want to deliver
the ideas contained here, I propose that this big speech, or two big general speeches, then drive a
series of major policy addresses over the next six months on 1) development, 2) human rights and
democracy (you could give that one at the Community of Democracies meeting in Lisbon and July
and outline your distinctive approach to using democracy as tool to improve people's lives through
more accountable government), 3) global governance/making multilateralism work (you could give
that one at the UN), and then several on more specific policies such as a strategy for failing and
failed states, climate change/energy security, creating global economic opportunity, a global
educational initiative, etc. This would all build up to an idea that PJ has proposed of giving a "State
of the World Address" in December before the President's State of the Union address in January.
You will see here that I describe the overall grand strategy (our broad plan for employing the
various instruments of national power to advance the U.S. national interest and other national goals)
as partnership, which I then qualify in terms of pragmatic and principled partnership. I do that
because lots of conversations have convinced me that the strategy itself has to be summed up in one
or two words w/o adjectives — e.g. containment, engagement, power-balancing, isolationism, liberal
internationalism. That's the difference b/w a strategy and a slogan. The principled and pragmatic
parts are critical, but they should come in the elaboration of the strategy if this is too have legs.
I have road-tested this in roughly 8-10 different presentations, largely in house to our new
ambassadors and lots of different classes of FSOs and folks from the rest of government over at the
Foreign Service Institute, but also at closed presentations at think tanks. The response has been very
positive in terms of the way this frame brings a lot of different things together. Various other ideas
here have also been previewed in your speeches and testimony already.
I am leaving for Asia on Wednesday for policy planning tglks w/ my Chinese counterpart,
for a trilat policy planning talk w/ my Japanese and Korean counterparts (these are all established
before me), and then w/ my G-8 counterparts and also the other 6 countries invited to L'Aquila. I
will have lots of time on planes to revise and incorporate comments from you and the rest of the
team, as well as working w/ Lissa. We will then still have a full week when I get back before the
earliest day you might give this speech. I have loved working on this; if we get it right you will stand
w/ Marshall and Kissinger as a Secretary of State who took American foreign policy in a new and
bold direction in response to changing historical circumstance.

NOTE FOR DEPUTY SECRETARY LEW
SUBJECT: Afghanistan: Inappropriate Behavior by Department Contractor
FROM: 1NL — David T. Johnson
Over the course of the last few weeks, employees of DynCorp International,
the INL contractor in Afghanistan providing police trainers, aviation support, and
security, have been discovered in a series of compromising situations.
Based on this continuing pattern of allegations concerning inappropriate
conduct in Afghanistan, I called in DynCorp International's corporate management
April 16, to make crystal clear that:

SENSITIVE BUT UNCLASSIFIED

The message was conveyed clearly and bluntly, and given the pattern of
behavior, we will be watching closely for remedial actions. The DynCorp team
was contrite, admitted that their internal controls were clearly inadequate if these
things had occurred, and committed to take effective action, beginning with a visit
by senior management to Kabul next week.

Response:
James Kunder, Senior Fellow at the German Marshall Fund and
former Acting Deputy Administrator, U.S. Agency for International
Development
The United States is the largest national donor of foreign aid in the
world. It is engaged in two major wars, each of which require
improving local economic conditions to achieve success. And it
faces a variety of challenges around the world—from responding to
natural disasters to promoting democratic governance—that demand
effective responses.
Despite these circumstances, the United States does not have a
comprehensive, coherent strategy to guide its development assistance
programs. With the advent of a new administration, the time is ripe
to have a serious policy discussion about the merits of a National
Strategy for Global Development.
The Sustainable Security Program at the Center for American
Progress has written a National Strategy for Global Development,
which it hopes will spark debate. The authors of the document, Dr.
Reuben E. Brigety, II and Sabina Dewan, will discuss their proposal
for an NSGD at this event. They will be joined by Mr. James
Kunder, senior fellow at the German Marshall Fund and former
acting deputy administrator of the U.S. Agency for International
Development.

I'm wound up about my concept of 21st century statecraft (and loved hearing those words come out of HRC's mouth at
NYU) and am wound up about the possibilities of government to people and people to government communication as a
way of revolutionizing statecraft and empowering people across the globe. I think this can be a major part of HRC's
legacy.
Anyway . here's the requested content for your review:

It is actually not a full cabinet meeting today -- those agencies that received recovery money were invited to
attend/participate. We were welcome to send a representative though, not sure if we have anyone going.

Subject: DPRK AMCTI" DETENTIONS CONFERENCE CALL
CA/OCS and EAP/K held a one-hour conference call today with the families of the detained journalists. During
the call, we briefed the families on the Swedish Ambassador's consular visit with Ms. Ling and Ms. Lee on May
15; recent progress on efforts to arrange
the release of the two women; an update on the proposed letter from the Secretary;
Media: Although the families have thus far shown restraint from approaching the media to publicize their
story, they are increasingly anxious in response to the DPRK's announcement of a June 4 trial date. They now
feel that a media appeal is necessary and would be helpful to their case, citing the public attention given the
Saberi case. They are considering doing interviews on Larry King Live and/or The O'Reilly Factor.

Colombo (AP) — Sri Lanka's military says special forces have killed the head of the Tamil Tigers' political wing and two
other top leaders in the northern war zone. There has been no word yet on the whereabouts of the group's top leader,
Velupillai Prabhakaran. A senior military official says an attack Sunday night killed rebels' political wing leaders
Balasingham Nadesan, head of rebels' peace secretariat Seevaratnam Puleedevan and a military leader known as
Ramesh.
